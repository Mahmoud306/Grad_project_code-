              "['Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide. Lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has been shown to reduce lung cancer specific mortality. In 2013, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended annual lung cancer screening with LDCT for smokers aged between 55 years to 80 years, with at least 30 pack-years of smoking exposure that currently smoke or who have quit smoking within 15 years. Risk-based lung cancer screening is an alternative approach that defines screening eligibility based on the personal risk of individuals. Selection of individuals for lung cancer screening based on their personal lung cancer risk has been shown to improve the sensitivity and specificity associated with the eligibility criteria of the screening program as compared to the 2013 USPSTF criteria. Numerous risk prediction models have been developed to estimate the lung cancer risk of individuals incorporating sociodemographic, smoking, and clinical risk factors associated with lung cancer, including age, smoking history, sex, race/ethnicity, personal and family history of cancer, and history of emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), among others. Some risk prediction models include biomarker information, such as germline mutations or protein-based biomarkers as independent risk predictors, in addition to clinical, smoking, and sociodemographic risk factors. While, the majority of lung cancer risk prediction models are suitable for selecting high-risk individuals for lung cancer screening, some risk models have been developed to predict the probability of malignancy of screen-detected solidary pulmonary nodules or to optimize the screening frequency of eligible individuals by incorporating past screening findings. In this systematic review, we provide an overview of existing risk prediction models and their applications to lung cancer screening. We discuss potential strengths and limitations of lung cancer screening using risk prediction models and future research directions.',\n",

This paper is a systematic review of nutritional interventions aiming to improve cachexia outcomes in cancer, focusing on weight gain. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: A search in Medline and Elsevier databases for articles up until the 23 January 2022, was conducted. <i>Results</i>: Out of 5732 screened records, 26 publications were included in the final analysis. Four randomized clinical trials showed a significant body weight (BW) increase in patients treated with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), β-hydroxy-beta-methyl butyrate (β-HMB), arginine, and glutamine or marine phospholipids (MPL). An upward BW trend was observed in patients treated with L-carnitine, an Ethanwell/Ethanzyme (EE) regimen enriched with ω-3 fatty acids, micronutrients, probiotics, fish oil, a leucine-rich supplement, or total parental nutrition (TPN) with a high dose of a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA). <i>Conclusions</i>: Although clinical trials relating to large numbers of nutritional supplements present promising data, many trials provided negative results. Further studies investigating the underlying mechanisms of action of these nutritional supplements in cancer cachexia are needed. Early screening for cancer cachexia risk and nutritional intervention in cancer patients before aggravating weight loss may stabilize their weight, preventing cachexia syndrome. According to the GRADE methodology, no positive recommendation for these nutritional supplements may be expressed.',\n",
              " 'Gastric cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths with considerable heterogeneity among patients. Appropriate classifications are essential for prognosis prediction and individualized treatment. Although immunotherapy showed potential efficacy in a portion of patients with gastric cancer, few studies have tried to classify gastric cancer specifically based on immune signatures. In this study, we established a 3-subtype cluster with low (C<sub>LIM</sub>), medium (C<sub>MIM</sub>), and high (C<sub>HIM</sub>) enrichment of immune signatures based on immunogenomic profiling. We validated the classification in multiple independent datasets. The C<sub>HIM</sub> subtype exhibited a relatively better prognosis and showed features of \"hot tumors\", including low tumor purity, high stromal components, overexpression of immune checkpoint molecules, and enriched tumor-infiltrated immune cells (activated T cells and macrophages). In addition, C<sub>HIM</sub> tumors were also characterized by frequent <i>ARID1A</i> mutation, rare <i>TP53</i> mutation, hypermethylation status, and altered protein expression (HER2, β-catenin, Cyclin E1, PREX1, LCK, PD-L1, Transglutaminase, and cleaved Caspase 7). By Gene Set Variation Analysis, \"TGFβ signaling pathway\" and \"GAP junction\" were enriched in C<sub>LIM</sub> tumors and inversely correlated with CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration. Of note, the C<sub>HIM</sub> patients showed a higher response rate to immunotherapy (44.4% vs. 11.1% and 16.7%) and a more prolonged progression-free survival (4.83 vs. 1.86 and 2.75 months) than C<sub>MIM</sub> and C<sub>LIM</sub> patients in a microsatellite-independent manner. In conclusion, the new immune signature-based subtypes have potential therapeutic and prognostic implications for gastric cancer management, especially immunotherapy.',\n",

Overall, 54.5% of pediatric oncology patients received any palliative service prior to death. Data revealed PC discussion does not occur until late in the illness trajectory, and PC does not begin until close to time of death. Despite efforts to spur earlier initiation, many pediatric oncology patients do not receive any palliative care service, and those who do, predominantly receive it near the time of death. Delays occur both at first PC discussion and at PC initiation. Efforts for early PC integration must recognize the complex determinants of PC utilization across the illness timeline.',\n",

However, these patients continue to have a high risk of recurrence and death. Unfortunately, there has been little progress in the treatment of resectable NSCLC over the past several decades. Neoadjuvant therapy, which has been considered as an approach to improve survival in patients with resectable NSCLC, is a hotly debated topic. A systematic review of 32 randomized trials involving 10,000 patients revealed that there was no difference in survival between preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy. Because of such results and the theoretical concern about resectable tumors progressing on relatively ineffective neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and thus becoming unresectable, neoadjuvant chemotherapy fell out of favor, and many clinicians preferred adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. However, neoadjuvant therapy has been revived in the past couple of years, with emerging data from various ongoing trials suggesting that neoadjuvant immunotherapy may have significant efficacy and could potentially improve the survival of patients with resectable NSCLC. In this review article, we discuss the evidence supporting the role of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in the multimodal management of resectable NSCLC. We summarize early results of ongoing clinical trials and highlight the challenges in adopting a uniform definition of treatment \"success.\" We address hurdles to be overcome for seeking regulatory approval for neoadjuvant immunotherapy and establishing it as a standard of care. Finally, we provide some perspectives for the future.',\n",

              " \"<b>Background and Importance.</b>-Globally, almost one million new cases of stomach cancer were estimated to have occurred in 2012 (952,000 cases, 6.8% of the total), making it the fifth most common malignancy in the world, after lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate. Gastric cancer was the world's third leading cause of cancer mortality in 2012, responsible for 723,000 deaths, 8.8% of total cancer deaths. <sup>1</sup> In 2017, 28,000 new cases and 10,960 deaths are estimated for gastric cancer in the United States. <sup>2</sup> Estimated United States prevalence counts on January 1, 2014, for patients diagnosed within the previous 5-years was 48,271 (SEER Cancer Statistics Review-2014). Prognostic indices of survival & mortality in patients with gastric cancer are related to tumor stage including nodal involvement, direct tumor extension beyond the gastric wall, and wide-spread dissemination. Tumor histologic grade (degree of loss of cellular differentiation), and oncotype-specific ICD-O-3 phenotypes also provides important prognostic information. By more than 90%, the most common histologic type of stomach cancer is adenocarcinoma. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) ICD-O-3 SEER Site/Histology Validation List catalog (September 18, 2015) enumerates almost 200 subtypes for gastric cancer sites C160-C166, C168-C169. Based on the results of molecular evaluation of 295 primary gastric adenocarcinomas reported to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project in 2014, a novel classification separating gastric cancers into four subtypes according to Epstein-Barr virus positive status, microsatellite instability, chromosomal instability, or genomic stability was proposed. <sup>3</sup> Of interest, <i>Helicobacter Pylori</i> infection and its role in the development of gastric cancer is not mentioned. All cancer has a genetic basis. However, given the histologic and etiologic heterogeneity of gastric cancer, eventual comprehensive molecular characterization and genomic sequencing with identification of chromosomal aberrations, nucleotide substitutions mortality follow-up study is focused on short- and long-term comparative patient outcomes of stomach adenocarcinoma, ICD-O-3 8140-8147, and other selected gastric cancer oncotypes. <b>Objective.</b>-To update trends in incidence, prevalence, short- and long-term survival, and mortality of gastric cancer using the statistical database of SEER*Stat 8.3.4 for diagnosis years 1973-2014 employing multiple case selection variables. <b>Methods.</b>-A retrospective, population-based study using nationally representative data from the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program to evaluate 157,258 cases for diagnosis years 1973-2014 comparing multiple variables of age, sex, race, stage, grade, cohort entry time-period, disease duration and histologic oncotype: Relative survival statistics were analyzed in two cohorts: 1973-1994 and 1995-2014. Survival statistics were derived from: SEER*Stat Database: Incidence\\xa0- SEER 9 Regs Research Data, November 2016 Submission (1973-2014) <Katrina/Rita Population Adjustment> Released April 2017. <b>Results.</b>-By more than 90%, the most common type of stomach cancer is adenocarcinoma. From 1975 to 2014, gastric cancer incidence has been steadily decreasing in the United States at the rate of -1.5% per year. In a total of 157,258 cases of invasive staged cancer of the stomach, mean age in males was 67.5 years, females 69.6\\xa0years, both male & female 67.4 years. Greater than 90% of cases occurred between ages 45-85+ years with the zenith in males at 70-74 years (15.1%) and 85+ years in females (17.9%). The overall annual US death rate per 100,000 per year for stomach cancer from 1975 to 2014 has decreased from 5.1 to 3.1, but excess mortality at 0-5 years remains exceedingly high. Mortality is a function of incidence and survival, and unfortunately, almost all of this decrease is due to the decrease in incidence of stomach cancer. Of the 157,258 invasive cases, 86.6% were clinically staged and 76.8% were histologically graded. <b>Conclusions.</b>-Given the histologic and etiologic heterogeneity of gastric cancer, major improvements in mortality and survival outcomes await the development of diagnostic markers for earlier diagnosis, and genomic sequencing and identification of chromosomal aberrations, nucleotide substitutions and epigenetic modifications that drive malignant transformation, for the development of targeted therapies for almost 200 gastric cancer subtypes.\",\n",

We investigated the extent to which LAN, including outdoor and indoor exposure, affects breast cancer risk. We performed a systematic review of epidemiological evidence on the association between LAN exposure and breast cancer risk, using a dose-response meta-analysis to examine the shape of the relation. We retrieved 17 eligible studies through September 13, 2021, including ten cohort and seven case-control studies. In the analysis comparing highest versus lowest LAN exposure, we found a positive association between exposure and disease risk (risk ratio [RR] 1.11, 95% confidence interval-CI 1.07-1.15), with comparable associations in case-control studies (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.98-1.34) and cohort studies (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.15). In stratified analyses, risk was similar for outdoor and indoor LAN exposure, while slightly stronger risks were observed for premenopausal women (premenopausal: RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.04-1.28; postmenopausal: 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.13) and for women with estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer (ER\\u2009+\\u2009: RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.17; ER-: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.92-1.23). The dose-response meta-analysis, performed only in studies investigating outdoor LAN using comparable exposure assessment, showed a linear relation up to 40 nW/cm<sup>2</sup>/sr after which the curve flattened, especially among premenopausal women.

The primary objective of this systematic review is to describe the reported disparities in screening, diagnostics, and treatments as well as efforts to alleviate these disparities through community and educational outreach efforts. Critical review took place of retrospective, prospective, and socially descriptive data of English language publications in the PubMed database. Despite more advanced presentation, lower rates of screening and diagnostic procedures, and low rates of trial inclusion, subanalyses have shown that various modalities of therapy are quite effective in Black populations. Moreover, patients treated on prospective clinical trials and within equal-access care environments have shown similar outcomes regardless of race. Additional prospective studies and enhanced participation in screening, diagnostic and genetic testing, clinical trials, and community-based educational endeavors are important to ensure equitable progress in prostate cancer for all patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Notable progress has been made with therapeutic advances for prostate cancer, but racial disparities continue to exist. Differing rates in screening and utility in diagnostic procedures play a role in these disparities. Black patients often present with more advanced disease, higher prostate-specific antigen, and other adverse factors, but outcomes can be attenuated in trials or in equal-access care environments. Recent data have shown that multiple modalities of therapy are quite effective in Black populations.

To better understand the efficacy of such interventions, a systematic review was performed of data from randomized controlled trials concerning the influence of beta-carotene supplementation on lung cancer risk in subjects with no lung cancer before the intervention. The search corpus comprised a number of databases and eight studies involving 167,141 participants, published by November 2021. The findings indicate that beta-carotene supplementation was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (RR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.06-1.26).

Thus, targeting the expression of known oncogenes in pancreatic cancer has been shown to lead to more effective treatment [3]. This chapter discusses the complexity of metabolic features in pancreatic cancers. In order to comprehend the heterogeneous nature of cancer metabolism fully, we need to take into account the close relationship between cancer metabolism and genetics. Gene expression varies tremendously, not only among different types of cancers but also within the same type of cancer among different patients. Cancer metabolism heterogeneity is often prompted and perpetuated not only by mutations in oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes but also by the innate diversity of the tumor microenvironment. Much effort has been focused on elucidating the genetic alterations that correlate with disease progression and treatment response [4, 5].

Annually, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) causes more than 100,000 deaths worldwide [1-4], posing an urgent need to develop effective treatments to increase patient survival outcomes. New therapies are expected to address a major factor contributing to cancer's resistance to standard therapies: oncogenic heterogeneity. Gene expression can vary tremendously among different types of cancers, different patients of the same tumor type, and even within individual tumors; various metabolic phenotypes can emerge, making singletherapy approaches insufficient. Novel strategies targeting the diverse metabolism of cancers aim to overcome this obstacle. Though some have yielded positive results, it remains a challenge to uncover all of the distinct metabolic profiles of RCC. In the quest to overcome this obstacle, the metabolic oriented research focusing on these cancers has offered freshly new perspectives, which are expected to contribute heavily to the development of new treatments.\",\n",

The logical question that arises is simple: Why, despite all the technologies and medical innovations of our time, has a complete cure eluded us? This chapter sheds light on one of cancer's most impactful attributes: its heterogeneity and, more specifically, the intratumoral heterogeneity of cancer metabolism.

Persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic substances are chemicals that can subsist for decades in human tissues and the environment. They include heavy metals, organochlorines, polychlorinated biphenyls, organobromines, organofluorines, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons among others. Although humans are often exposed to multiple pollutants simultaneously, their negative effects on health have generally been studied for each one separately. Among the most severe of these harmful effects is cancer. Here, to compile and analyze the available evidence on the relationship between exposure to mixtures of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals and the risk of developing cancer in the general population, we provide a systematic review based on the main databases (Cochrane, PubMed and Embase), together with complementary sources, using the general methodology of the PRISMA Statement. The articles analyzed were selected by two researchers working independently and their quality was evaluated by reference to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The initial search yielded 2379 results from the main sources of information and 22 from the complementary ones. After the article selection process, 22 were included in the final review (21 case-control studies and one cohort study). Analysis of the selected studies revealed that most of the mixtures analyzed were positively associated with risk of cancer, especially that of the breast, colon-rectum or testis, and more strongly so than each contaminant alone. In view of the possible stronger association observed with the development of cancer for some mixtures of pollutants than when each one is present separately, exposure to mixtures should also be monitored and measured, preferably in cohort designs, to complement the traditional approach to persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals. The results presented should be taken into account in public health policies in order to strengthen the regulatory framework for cancer prevention and control.',\n",
              " 'According to data from the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases and cancer are the two leading causes of mortality in the world [1]. Despite the immense effort to study these diseases and the constant innovation in treatment modalities, the number of deaths associated with cardiovascular diseases and cancer is predicted to increase in the coming decades [1]. From 2008 to 2030, due to population growth and population aging in many parts of the world, the number of deaths caused by cancer globally is projected to increase by 45%, corresponding to an annual increase of around four million people [1]. For cardiovascular diseases, this number is six million people [1]. In the United States, treatments for these two diseases are among the most costly and result in a disproportionate impact on low- and middleincome people. As the fight against these fatal diseases continues, it is crucial that we continue our investigation and broaden our understanding of cancer and cardiovascular diseases to innovate our prognostic and treatment approaches. Even though cardiovascular diseases and cancer are usually studied independently [2-12], there are some striking overlaps between their metabolic behaviors and therapeutic targets, suggesting the potential application of cardiovascular disease treatments for cancer therapy. More specifically, both cancer and many cardiovascular diseases have an upregulated glutaminolysis pathway, resulting in low glutamine and high glutamate circulating levels. Similar treatment modalities, such as glutaminase (GLS) inhibition and glutamine supplementation, have been identified to target glutamine metabolism in both cancer and some cardiovascular diseases. Studies have also found similarities in lipid metabolism, specifically fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and synthesis. Pharmacological inhibition of FAO and fatty acid synthesis have proven effective against many cancer types as well as specific cardiovascular conditions. Many of these treatments have been tested in clinical trials, and some have been medically prescribed to patients to treat certain diseases, such as angina pectoris [13, 14]. Other metabolic pathways, such as tryptophan catabolism and pyruvate metabolism, were also dysregulated in both diseases, making them promising treatment targets. Understanding the overlapping traits exhibited by both cancer metabolism and cardiovascular disease metabolism can give us a more holistic view of how important metabolic dysregulation is in the progression of diseases. Using established links between these illnesses, researchers can take advantage of the discoveries from one field and potentially apply them to the other. In this chapter, we highlight some promising therapeutic discoveries that can support our fight against cancer, based on common metabolic traits displayed in both cancer and cardiovascular diseases.',\n",

Despite the high risk of VTE recurrence and death in patients with cancer and the favorable benefit-risk profile of LMWH demonstrated in randomized-control studies, the implementation of treatment guidelines remains insufficient in the clinical practice. A systematic review of observational studies, registries and surveys reveals that approximately only 50% of patients with CAT are treated according to practice guidelines while both physicians and patients may be accountable for this situation. Based on the few available published data, we have observed differences between guidelines and clinical practice and we have identified factors influencing patient's management with the perspective to improve adherence to clinical practice guidelines in patients with CAT. Improving the implementation of clinical practice guidelines requires a better knowledge of physician and patient-related factors that influence therapeutic decisions. A global approach of patients with CAT is warranted to optimize the therapeutic management of cancer-associated VTE.\",\n",

We provide an overview of the studies investigating microRNA expression in relation to cervical cancer (CC) progression, highlighting their common outcomes and target gene interactions according to the regulatory pathways. To achieve this, we systematically searched through PubMed MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar for all articles between April 2010 and April 2020, in accordance with the PICO acronym (participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes). From 27 published reports, totaling 1721 cases and 1361 noncancerous control tissue samples, 26 differentially expressed microRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were identified in different International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages of cervical cancer development. It was identified that some of the dysregulated microRNAs were associated with specific stages of cervical cancer development. The results indicated that DEmiRNAs in different stages of cervical cancer were functionally involved in several key hallmarks of cancer, such as evading growth suppressors, enabling replicative immortality, activation of invasion and metastasis, resisting cell death, and sustained proliferative signaling. These dysregulated microRNAs could play an important role in cervical cancer's development. Some of the stage-specific microRNAs can also be used as biomarkers for cancer classification and monitoring the progression of cervical cancer.\",\n",
              " \"Precision diagnostic testing (PDT) employs appropriate biomarkers to identify cancer patients that may optimally respond to precision medicine (PM) approaches, such as treatments with targeted agents and immuno-oncology drugs. To date, there are no published systematic appraisals evaluating the cost-effectiveness of PDT in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To address this gap, we conducted Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses searches for the years 2009-2019. Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards were employed to screen, assess and extract data. Employing base costs, life years gained or quality-adjusted life years, as well as willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold for each country, net monetary benefit was calculated to determine cost-effectiveness of each intervention. Thirty-seven studies (50%) were included for analysis; a further 37 (50%) were excluded, having failed population-, intervention-, comparator-, outcomes- and study-design criteria. Within the 37 studies included, we defined 64 scenarios. Eleven scenarios compared PDT-guided PM with non-guided therapy [epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), n\\xa0=\\xa05; programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), n\\xa0=\\xa06]. Twenty-eight scenarios compared PDT-guided PM with chemotherapy alone (anaplastic lymphoma kinase, n\\xa0=\\xa03; EGFR, n\\xa0=\\xa017; PD-L1, n\\xa0=\\xa08). Twenty-five scenarios compared PDT-guided PM with chemotherapy alone, while varying the PDT approach. Thirty-four scenarios (53%) were cost-effective, 28 (44%) were not cost-effective, and two were marginal, dependent on their country's WTP threshold. When PDT-guided therapy was compared with a therapy-for-all patients approach, all scenarios (100%) proved cost-effective. Seven of 37 studies had been structured appropriately to assess PDT-PM cost-effectiveness. Within these seven studies, all evaluated scenarios were cost-effective. However, 81% of studies had been poorly designed. Our systematic analysis implies that more robust health economic evaluation could help identify additional approaches towards PDT cost-effectiveness, underpinning value-based care and enhanced outcomes for patients with NSCLC.\",\n",

Socioeconomic status (SES) has been shown to be associated with melanoma incidence. However, it is unclear if this association holds true in universal healthcare systems where screening, diagnostic, and treatment services are available to all patients. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence on the association of SES and melanoma incidence in Canada. A comprehensive search of PubMed and EMBASE yielded 7 studies reporting on melanoma incidence or outcomes with respect to SES in Canada. High SES was associated with increased melanoma incidence across all studies, which encompassed all Canadian provinces, and time periods spanning from 1979 to 2012. Studies also reported an increasing incidence of melanoma over time. There were substantial discrepancies in melanoma incidence across Canadian provinces, after controlling for SES and demographic characteristics. Populations of lower SES and living within certain healthcare regions had increased risks of advanced melanoma at diagnosis. This review highlights the potential for inequities in access to care even within a universal healthcare system. Future research is needed to characterize specific risk factors within different patient groups and within the universal health system context in order to implement targeted strategies to lower melanoma incidence, morbidity, and mortality.',\n",

In this systematic review, we investigated the whole hierarchy of defense mechanisms and how they associate with various psychological aspects in cancer patients. A literature search was conducted using electronic databases. Among 1570 records published from 1990 to date, only 15 articles met inclusion criteria. Findings related to cancer patients' defensive functioning and its relations with other physical and psychological variables were extracted. A general consistency emerges on the role of defense mechanisms in cancer progression and recovery. Following the hierarchical organization of defenses, higher physical and emotional functioning emerged as being associated with High-adaptive defenses, while Mental Inhibition defenses, in particular repression, promote psychosomatic symptoms, passive decisional preferences and worse physical and emotional health. Disavowal defenses foster lower anxiety and higher emotional functioning by denying anxiety about death. Image distortion defenses, including both Minor and Major image-distorting defenses, were more frequent in cancer patients than in control groups and finally, Action defenses predicted sleep disturbance and lower survival probability. The early detection of maladaptive defensive functioning may foster appropriate psychotherapeutic intervention and prevent worsening of the illness.

Methods and Results We assessed cancer, cardiovascular, and total mortality in phase 3 heart failure RCTs involving ≥90% individuals with left ventricular ejection fraction <45%, who were not acutely decompensated and did not represent specific patient subsets. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) of each type of death for the control and treatment arms were calculated using a random-effects model. Temporal trends and the impact of patient and RCT characteristics on mortality outcomes were evaluated by meta-regression analysis. Cancer mortality was reported for 15 (25%) of 61 RCTs, including 33\\xa0709 subjects, and accounted for 6% to 14% of all deaths and 17% to 67% of noncardiovascular deaths. Cancer mortality rate was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.46-0.71) per 100 patient-years without temporal trend (<i>P</i>=0.35). Cardiovascular (<i>P</i>=0.001) and total (<i>P</i>=0.001) mortality rates instead decreased over time.

This systematic review and meta-analysis explores the influence of microRNA (miRNA) expressions on chemoresistance in head and neck cancers (HNC). The objective is to evaluate the theragnostic effects of microRNA expressions on chemoresistance in HNC patients and investigate the utility of miRNAs as biomarkers and avenues for new therapeutic targets. <b>Methods</b>: We performed a comprehensive bibliographic search that included the SCOPUS, PubMed, and Science Direct bibliographic databases. These searches conformed to a predefined set of search strategies. Following the PRISMA guidelines, inclusion and exclusion criteria were framed upon completing the literature search. The data items extracted were tabulated and collated in MS Excel. This spreadsheet was used to determine the effect size estimation for the theragnostic effects of miRNA expressions on chemoresistance in HNC, the hazard ratio (HR), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The comprehensive meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model. Heterogeneity among the data collected was assessed using the Q test, Tau<sup>2</sup>, I<sup>2</sup>, and Z measures. Publication bias of the included studies was checked using the Egger's bias indicator test, Orwin and classic fail-safe N test, Begg and Mazumdar rank collection test, and Duval and Tweedie's trim and fill methods. <b>Results:</b> After collating the data from 23 studies, dysregulation of 34 miRNAs was observed in 2189 people. These data were gathered from 23 studies. Out of the 34 miRNAs considered, 22 were up-regulated, while 12 were down-regulated. The TaqMan transcription kits were the most used miRNA profiling platform, and miR-200c was seen to have a mixed dysregulation. We measured the overall pooled effect estimate of HR to be 1.516 for the various analyzed miRNA at a 95% confidence interval of 1.303-1.765, with a significant <i>p</i>-value. The null hypothesis test's Z value was 5.377, and the <i>p</i>-value was correspondingly noted to be less than 0.0001. This outcome indicates that the risk of death is determined to be higher in up-regulated groups than in down-regulated groups. Among the 34 miRNAs that were investigated, seven miRNAs were associated with an improved prognosis, especially with the overexpression of these seven miRNAs (miR15b-5p, miR-548b, miR-519d, miR-1278, miR-145, miR-200c, Hsa- miR139-3p). <b>Discussion:</b> The findings reveal that intricate relationships between miRNAs' expression and chemotherapeutic resistance in HNC are more likely to exist and can be potential therapeutic targets. This review suggests the involvement of specific miRNAs as predictors of chemoresistance and sensitivity in HNC. The examination of the current study results illustrates the significance of miRNA expression as a theragnostic biomarker in medical oncology.\",\n",

The objective of this article was to systematically review the literature regarding DIC in pediatric malignancies. PubMed and Embase were searched for relevant articles on January 31, 2020. In total, 6,070 articles were identified out of which 24 articles met inclusion and exclusion criteria. These were included in the qualitative synthesis. The National Institutes of Health's Quality Assessment Tools was used to assess bias in the included articles. The studies were of only moderate quality mainly based on medical charts and demonstrated high heterogeneity, especially as regards to diagnostic criteria. DIC was reported most frequently in patients with acute leukemia, particularly the subtype acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Standard coagulation parameters were used as diagnostic laboratory tests supporting the diagnosis of DIC. Hemorrhage was the predominant clinical manifestation, whereas thromboembolic events and organ failure were reported less frequently. Unfractionated heparin, platelet concentrate and fresh frozen plasma were the most frequently used supportive treatment agents. Hemorrhage accounted for the majority of deaths in children with acute leukemia and solid tumors. In conclusion, only a limited number of studies, being heterogenous and of moderate quality, have investigated DIC in pediatric malignancy. Notably, this entity seems to be complicated mainly by hemorrhage. High quality studies are needed to evaluate diagnosis, clinical manifestations and optimal treatment of DIC in childhood cancers.\",\n",

However, master regulators of apoptosis (e.g., p53, p16/CDKN2A) are frequently genetically inactivated in cancers, resulting in multidrug resistance. An alternative, p53-independent method for terminating malignant proliferation is to engage terminal-differentiation. Normally, the exponential proliferation of lineage-committed progenitors, coordinated by the master transcription factor (TF) MYC, is self-limited by forward-differentiation to terminal lineage-fates. In cancers, however, this exponential proliferation is disengaged from terminal-differentiation. The mechanisms underlying this decoupling are mostly unknown. We performed a systematic review of published literature (January 2007-June 2018) to identify gene pathways linked to differentiation-failure in three treatment-recalcitrant cancers: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ovarian cancer (OVC), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We analyzed key gene alterations in various apoptosis, proliferation and differentiation pathways to determine whether it is possible to predict treatment outcomes and suggest novel therapies. Poorly differentiated tumors were linked to poorer survival across histologies. Our analyses suggested loss-of-function events to master TF drivers of lineage-fates and their cofactors as being linked to differentiation-failure: genomic data in TCGA and ICGC databases demonstrated frequent haploinsufficiency of lineage master TFs (e.g., GATA4/6) in poorly differentiated tumors; the coactivators that these TFs use to activate genes (e.g. ARID1A, PBRM1) were also frequently inactivated by genetic mutation and/or deletion. By contrast, corepressor components (e.g., DNMT1, EED, UHRF1, and BAZ1A/B), that oppose coactivators to repress or turn off genes, were frequently amplified instead, and the level of amplification was highest in poorly differentiated lesions. This selection by neoplastic evolution towards unbalanced activity of transcriptional corepressors suggests these enzymes as candidate targets for inhibition aiming to re-engage forward-differentiation.

This systematic literature review aims at identifying studies on CTLA-4 expression in BC, and address what is known about its clinical meaning. A literature search was performed in PubMed and LILACS databases, using the MESH terms \"breast cancer\"; \"CTLA-4 Antigen/antagonists and inhibitors\"; and \"Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology\", published in the last 10\\xa0years. In total, 12 studies were included in this review. Systematic review used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Despite the small number of eligible studies, the literature reports some associations between CTLA-4 expression in the tumor microenvironment and worse BC outcomes, regardless of its molecular subtype. CTLA-4 expression in BC is a putative marker of clinical significance and a rationale therapeutic target in the emerging field of immunotherapy.',\n",

Progression-free survival was better in patients with OM disease (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.62, 95% CI 0.57-0.68; P <.001; n=69 studies). Also, OM cancers were associated with a better overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.62-0.68; P<.01; n=161 studies). In colorectal (CRC), breast, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) the reduction in the risk of death for OM patients were 35, 38, 30 and 42%, respectively. Biliary tract and cervical cancer do not significantly better in OM stage likely for paucity of data. <b>Conclusions</b>. Patients with OM cancers have a significantly better prognosis than those with more widespread stage IV tumors. In OM cancer patients a personalized approach should be pursued.',\n",

However, there are currently no standardised molecular markers that assist in determining HNC prognosis. The literature for this systematic review and meta-analysis were sourced from multiple bibliographic databases. This review followed PRISMA guidelines. The Hazard Ratio (HR) was selected as the effect size metric to independently assess overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and prognosis. Subgroup analysis was performed for individual highly represented miRNA. A total of 6843 patients across 50 studies were included in the systematic review and 34 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Studies across 12 countries were assessed, with China representing 36.7% of all included studies. The analysis of the survival endpoints of OS and DFS were conducted separately, with the overall pooled effect size (HR) for each being 1.825 (95% CI 1.527-2.181; <i>p</i> < 0.05) and 2.596 (95% CI 1.917-3.515; <i>p</i> < 0.05), respectively. Subgroup analysis was conducted for impact of miR-21, 200b, 155, 18a, 34c-5p, 125b, 20a and 375 on OS, and miR-21 and 34a on DFS. The pooled results were found to be statistically significant for both OS and DFS. The meta-analysis indicated that miRNA alterations can account for an 82.5% decrease in OS probability and a 159.6% decrease in DFS probability. These results indicate that miRNAs have potential clinical value as prognostic biomarkers in HNC, with miR-21, 125b, 34c-5p and 18a, in particular, showing great potential as prognostic molecular markers.

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is an important component of the cellular microenvironment and plays an important role in developing and regulating normal tissues and homeostasis. The pathological dynamics of the ECM contribute to several different processes such as endometriosis, infertility, cancer, and metastasis. Identifying changes in components of ECM is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of cancer development and its progression. We performed a systematic analysis of publications on the topic of changes in the extracellular matrix in cervical and endometrial cancer. The findings of this systematic review show that matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) play an important role impacting tumour growth in both types of cancer. MMPs degrade various specific substrates (collagen, elastin, fibronectin, aggrecan, fibulin, laminin, tenascin, vitronectin, versican, nidogen) and play a crucial role in the basal membrane degradation and ECM components. Similar types of MMPs were found to be increased in both cancers, namely, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-11. Elevated concentrations of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were correlated with the FIGO stage and are associated with poor prognosis in endometrial cancer, whereas in cervical cancer, elevated concentrations of MMP-9 have been associated with a better outcome. Elevated ADAMTS levels were found in cervical cancer tissues. Elevated disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) levels were also found in endometrial cancer, but their role is still unclear. Following these findings, this review reports on tissue inhibitors of ECM enzymes, MMPs, and ADAMTS.

We sought to investigate the prognostic significance of baseline ctDNA and postoperative ctDNA in patients with resectable PDAC. PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library were searched up to March 2019. Five studies met the inclusion criteria, and 375 patients were pooled for the meta-analysis.

Based on the results of the systematic review and meta-analysis, the average iAs levels in drinking water and all the food groups at the national level were lower than the maximum permissible levels. The total average non-carcinogenic risk of dietary exposure to iAs in terms of hazard index (HI) was 3.4. The average incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) values of dietary exposure to iAs were determined to be 1.5 × 10<sup>-3</sup> for skin cancer, 1.0 × 10<sup>-3</sup> for lung cancer, and 4.0 × 10<sup>-4</sup> for bladder cancer. Over two-thirds of the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk of dietary exposure to iAs was attributed to bread and cereals, drinking water, and rice. The total annual cancer incidence, deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), death rate, and DALY rate (per 100,000 people) were assessed to be 3347 (95 % uncertainty interval: 1791 to 5999), 1302 (697 to 2336), 72,606 (38,833 to 130,228), 1.6 (0.87 to 2.9), and 91 (49 to 160).

Data regarding systemic treatment regimens, progression free survival and overall survival were extracted. The outcomes were compared using a random effects model. The index I2 and the graphs of funnel plot were used for the interpretation of the data. Of 1,052 abstracts, 7 randomized trials were considered eligible with a combined sample size of 2,975 MPC patients. Combining the studies with meta-analysis, we could see that patients with liver metastasis had a HR for death of 1.53 with 95% CI of 1.15 to 2.02 (p-value 0.003) and HR for risk of progression of 1.96 with 95% CI of 1.28 to 2.99 (p-value 0.002), without significant heterogeneity. Having two or more sites of metastasis comparing to one site did not have impact on overall survival; RR of 1.05 with 95% CI 0.91 to 1.23 (p-value 0.493). In conclusion, liver metastasis confers worse outcomes among patients with MPC.

For supplemental and total magnesium intakes, we did not find any significant associations with risks of all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality. However, linear dose-response meta-analysis indicated that each additional intake of 100\\xa0mg/d of dietary magnesium was associated with a 6% and 5% reduced risk of all-cause and cancer mortality, respectively. In conclusion, higher intake of dietary magnesium was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause and cancer mortality, but not CVD mortality. Supplemental and total magnesium intakes were not associated with the risk of all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality. These findings indicate that consumption of magnesium from dietary sources may be beneficial in reducing all-cause and cancer mortality and thus have practical importance for public health.',\n",
              " 'Cancer is the second leading contributor to global deaths caused by non-communicable diseases. The cancer cells are known to interact with the surrounding non-cancerous cells, including the immune cells and stromal cells, within the tumor microenvironment (TME) to modulate the tumor progression, metastasis and resistance. Currently, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the standard treatments for cancers. However, these treatments cause a significant number of side effects, as they damage both the cancer cells and the actively dividing normal cells indiscriminately. Hence, a new generation of immunotherapy using natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes or macrophages was developed to achieve tumor-specific targeting and circumvent the adverse effects. However, the progression of cell-based immunotherapy is hindered by the combined action of TME and TD-EVs, which render the cancer cells less immunogenic. Recently, there has been an increase in interest in using immune cell derivatives to treat cancers. One of the highly potential immune cell derivatives is the NK cell-derived EVs (NK-EVs). As an acellular product, NK-EVs are resistant to the influence of TME and TD-EVs, and can be designed for \"off-the-shelf\" use. In this systematic review, we examine the safety and efficacy of NK-EVs to treat various cancers in vitro and in vivo.',\n",

Likewise, it is more common in those receiving programmed cell death (PD)-1/PD-1 ligand inhibitors rather than cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 inhibitors alone. The frequency of ICI-P is higher when anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 are administered concomitantly. Despite the low fatality rate (≈13%), ICI-P is the leading cause of ICI-related deaths. This narrative review focuses on the epidemiology, clinical and radiological presentation and prognosis of ICI-P occurring in patients, especially those with advanced NSCLC. Emphasis is placed on the differences in terms of frequency or clinical picture observed depending on whether the ICI is used as monotherapy or in combination with another ICI or chemotherapy.

Its definition and staging have been revised in the eight edition of the AJCC/TNM classification, which took effect in 2018. Novel molecular classifications for GC have been recently established and the process of translating these classifications into clinical practice is ongoing. The cornerstone of GC treatment is surgical, in a context of multimodal therapy. Surgical treatment is being standardized, and is evolving according to new anatomical concepts and to the recent technological developments. This is leading to a massive improvement in the use of mini-invasive techniques. Mini-invasive techniques aim to be equivalent to open surgery from an oncologic point of view, with better short-term outcomes. The persecution of better short-term outcomes also includes the optimization of the perioperative management, which is being implemented on large scale according to the enhanced recovery after surgery principles. In the era of precision medicine, multimodal treatment is also evolving. The long-time-awaited results of many trials investigating the role for preoperative and postoperative management have been published, changing the clinical practice. Novel investigations focused both on traditional chemotherapeutic regimens and targeted therapies are currently ongoing. Modern platforms increase the possibility for further standardization of the different treatments, promote the use of big data, and open new possibilities for surgical learning.

Therefore, this biomarker cannot be currently used as a screening or diagnostic tool. Increasing evidence suggests that ctDNA is a relevant candidate biomarker to assess minimal residual disease after radical surgery, but also a strong independent biomarker linked to a poor prognosis in advanced PA. Some recent data also indicates that ctDNA is an attractive biomarker for longitudinal follow-up and possibly early treatment adaptation. Its role in tumor profiling in advanced disease to decide targeted treatments remains to be explored. Altogether, ctDNA appears to be a reliable prognostic tool. Though promising results have been reported, further studies are still needed to define exactly how ctDNA can help physicians in the screening, diagnosis and treatment, as PA is expected to become a major cause of cancer-related deaths in the forthcoming decade.',\n",

The present study reassessed the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) data to investigate whether PORT can improve survival in resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The following databases were used to perform literature search: PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Embase (from January 1, 1986 to July 5, 2021). The results of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were calculated as hazard ratio (HR). Confidence intervals are chosen with 95% confidence intervals. A total of 12 RCTs and 19 retrospective cohort studies were found to meet the inclusion criteria. A significant DFS improvement was detected in the PORT group (4111 patients from 15 studies), although statistical difference was not detected for OS between the non-PORT and PORT groups (31 studies, 49,342 total patients). PORT prolonged OS in patients undergoing PORT plus postoperative chemotherapy (POCT) and in pN2 patients. Patients with a median radiation dose of 50.4 Gy and a median radiation dose of 54 Gy had a better OS after PORT. However, if the total radiotherapy dose went up to 60 Gy, PORT increased the risk of death in NSCLC patients. Significant difference in OS was not found in the results of studies with regard to treatment methods, pathologic stages, study type, radiation beam quality, and radiation dose. Patients undergoing postoperative chemoradiotherapy and pN2 patients can benefit from PORT. Patients exposed to median radiation doses of 50.4 and 54 Gy demonstrated relatively good efficacy. For patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, PORT has not been proven to extend OS, but its effect on DFS remains strong.',\n",

The development of Cushing's syndrome (CS) in MTC patients is generally associated with advanced disease and poor prognosis. <b><i>Summary:</i></b> We described a case of severe CS due to MTC in a young male. We performed a systematic review to identify cases of ECS due to MTC. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for publications between database inception and February 2022 and we collected the patient characteristics, disease presentation, employed treatment strategies, and disease outcomes. In addition to our patient, we identified 96 cases of ECS due to MTC reported in literature. Mean age at diagnosis was 44.4 years (range 10-84), and there was a male predominance (male:female [M:F]\\u2009=\\u20091.8:1). Most patients (51%) presented with metastatic disease at diagnosis and showed severe hypercortisolism. Seventeen patients developed distant metastasis and hypercortisolism during follow-up. Interestingly, in 48% of patients, the diagnosis of CS followed the diagnosis of MTC with a median time of 48 months but, among patients in whom the diagnosis was concomitant (38%), symptoms due to hypercortisolism were frequently the reason for seeking medical advice. Pathology results showed evidence of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) positive cells in 76% of patients in whom they were tested. The management of hypercortisolism was challenging in most patients with 48% requiring, eventually, definitive treatment with bilateral adrenalectomy (BLA). Recently, some limited evidence has emerged regarding tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) treatment for hypercortisolism in patients with ECS due to MTC. Despite limited information on survival, prognosis was generally poor and the main causes of death were either complications of CS or disease progression. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Despite its rarity, MTC should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ECS. Management of hypercortisolism is a key factor to improve the patient's symptoms but it is often challenging and BLA is frequently required. Further studies are needed for investigating the role of TKIs in patients with MTC with ECS.\",\n",

Alterations in BAP1, ARID1A, ARID2, and PBRM1 were detected through immunohistochemistry. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed to analyze FGFR2 fusions and CCND1 amplification. LELCC is histologically classified as predominantly undifferentiated or glandular. Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNA (EBER) expression was found in 16 LELCCs. Approximately 50% of LELCCs expressed programmed death-ligand 1 strongly. Notably, recurrent pTERT and TP53 mutations were detected in 9 (38%) and 8 (33%) tumors, respectively. Only 2 LELCCs exhibited loss of expression for PBRM1. Alterations in genes typically involved in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, including IDH1, IDH2, ARID1A, ARID2, and BAP1, and FGFR2 fusions, were not identified. The 2-step clustering analysis showed 2 distinct subgroups in LELCC, which were separated by EBER expression. A meta-analysis of all reported cases (n=85) has shown that EBER+ LELCC is strongly associated with the female sex, younger age, and exhibited predominantly glandular differentiation (P=0.001, 0.012, and <0.001, respectively).

Teledermatology provides a way for generalist clinicians to access the opinion of a specialist dermatologist for skin lesions that they consider to be suspicious without referring the patients through the normal referral pathway.

This determines the high significance of antithrombotic therapy for the treatment and secondary prevention of VTEC in this population. During recent years, low-molecular weight heparins (LMWH) have been a \"gold standard\" for the treatment of cancer-associated venous thrombosis (CAVT). In the recent decade, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have become extensively used for the treatment and prevention of VTEC relapse in non-oncological patients and also for primary prevention of VTEC following orthopedic surgery. Taking into account the oral route of administration, the predictable and convenient pharmacokinetic profile, and the absence of need for coagulation monitoring, it seems possible to use DOACs for the treatment and secondary prevention of VTEС in oncological patients. A meta-analysis of 4 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) showed a higher efficacy of DOACs compared to LMWHs, however, with a greater risk of bleedings in CAVT. In two of four studies using apixaban (more than 40% of weight in meta-analysis), no increase in bleedings was noted.Aim \\xa0 \\xa0The aim of this study was to perform a systematic search for comparative clinical studies with apixaban and to perform a meta-analysis to answer the question on clinical efficacy and safety of apixaban in the treatment and secondary prevention of recurrent VTEC in patients with CAVT.Material and methods \\xa0 \\xa0The systematic search was performed in three reference databases, Medline (PubMed), Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), and eLibrary.

              " 'Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) are multifunctional enzymes that oxidize diverse endogenous and exogenous aldehydes. We conducted a meta-analysis based on The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus data and detected genetic alterations in ALDH1A1, ALDH1A3, or ALDH3A1, 86% of which were gene amplification or mRNA upregulation, in 31% of nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). The expression of these isoenzymes impacted chemoresistance and shortened survival times in patients. We hypothesized that these enzymes provide an oxidative advantage for the persistence of NSCLC. To test this hypothesis, we used genetic and pharmacological approaches with DIMATE, an irreversible inhibitor of ALDH1/3. DIMATE showed cytotoxicity in 73% of NSCLC cell lines tested and demonstrated antitumor activity in orthotopic xenografts via hydroxynonenal-protein adduct accumulation, GSTO1-mediated depletion of glutathione and increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Consistent with this result, ALDH1/3 disruption synergized with ROS-inducing agents or glutathione synthesis inhibitors to trigger cell death. In lung cancer xenografts with high to moderate cisplatin resistance, combination treatment with DIMATE promoted strong synergistic responses with tumor regression. These results indicate that NSCLCs with increased expression of ALDH1A1, ALDH1A3, or ALDH3A1 may be targeted by strategies involving inhibitors of these isoenzymes as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy to overcome patient-specific drug resistance.',\n",

The definition of early lung cancer mortality is not consensual; thresholds range from 1 to 12 months post-diagnosis. This systematic review was undertaken to identify and analyze factors significantly associated with early lung cancer mortality. Age, male sex, non-adenocarcinoma histology, advanced stage at diagnosis and ECOG performance status are the main clinical factors of early lung cancer mortality. Active/ex-smoking also seems to favor early mortality, despite heterogeneous definitions of smoker status. For radio-chemotherapy treated locally advance disease, the early mortality rate increases according to tumor volume.

Clinical trials, post hoc analysis of clinical trials, and prospective studies on ICI treatment in patients with malignant solid tumors were included. Pooled incidence of pseudoprogression for all included studies, per definition of pseudoprogression, cancer type, and drug type, was obtained by random-effects models with inverse variance weighting model.ResultsSeventeen studies with 3402 patients were analyzed. The pooled incidence of pseudoprogression was 6.0% (95% confidence interval: 5.0%, 7.0%).

A literature search was conducted to collect all documented cases of a plasmacytoma originating in the sellar region. Patient characteristics, medical history, presentation, tumor characteristics, and survival data were collected. An additional case from our institution not previously reported was included. Thirty-one patients with sellar plasmacytomas were studied. Presenting symptoms were most commonly headache (68%), diplopia (65%) and visual field disturbances (10%). Fifteen patients (48%) were initially suspected of having a pituitary adenoma. Pathologic diagnosis of plasmacytoma preceded a finding of multiple myeloma in 14 cases (45%). Thirty patients (90%) had surgical intervention. Adjuvant therapy consisted of radiotherapy for twenty-five patients (81%) and chemotherapy for sixteen (52%).

              " 'With rapid advances in our understanding of cancer, there is an expanding number of potential novel combination therapies, including novel-novel combinations. Identifying which combinations are appropriate and in which subpopulations are among the most difficult questions in medical research. We conducted a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-guided systematic review of trials of novel-novel combination therapies involving immunotherapies or molecular targeted therapies in advanced solid tumors. A MEDLINE search was conducted using a modified Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for published clinical trials between July 1, 2017, and June 30, 2020, in the top-ranked medical and oncology journals. Trials were evaluated according to a criterion adapted from previously published Food and Drug Administration guidance and other key considerations in designing trials of combinations. This included the presence of a strong biological rationale, the use of a new established or emerging predictive biomarker prospectively incorporated into the clinical trial design, appropriate comparator arms of monotherapy or supportive external data sources and a primary endpoint demonstrating a clinically meaningful benefit. Of 32 identified trials, there were 11 (34%) trials of the novel-novel combination of anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) therapy, and 10 (31%) trials of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) combination therapy. 20 (62.5%) trials were phase II trials, while 12 (37.5%) were phase III trials. Most (72%) trials lacked significant preclinical evidence supporting the development of the combination in the given indication. A majority of trials (69%) were conducted in biomarker unselected populations or used pre-existing biomarkers within the given indication for patient selection. Most studies (66%) were considered to have appropriate comparator arms or had supportive external data sources such as prior studies of monotherapy. All studies were evaluated as selecting a clinically meaningful primary endpoint. In conclusion, designing trials to evaluate novel-novel combination therapies presents numerous challenges to demonstrate efficacy in a comprehensive manner. A greater understanding of biological rationale for combinations and incorporating predictive biomarkers may improve effective evaluation of combination therapies. Innovative statistical methods and increasing use of external data to support combination approaches are potential strategies that may improve the efficiency of trial design.

NSCLC patients with overexpressed or mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) related to disease progression are treated with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). Acquired drug resistance after TKI treatments has been a major focus for development of NSCLC therapies. This study aimed to establish afatinib-resistant cell lines from which afatinib resistance-associated genes are identified and the underlying mechanisms of multiple-TKI resistance in NSCLC can be further investigated. Nude mice bearing subcutaneous NSCLC HCC827 tumors were administered with afatinib at different dose intensities (5-100 mg/kg). We established three HCC827 sublines resistant to afatinib (IC<sub>50</sub> > 1 μM) with cross-resistance to gefitinib (IC<sub>50</sub> > 5 μM). cDNA microarray revealed several of these sublines shared 27 up- and 13 down-regulated genes. The mRNA expression of selective novel genes - such as transmembrane 4 L six family member 19 (TM4SF19), suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2), and quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT) - are responsive to afatinib treatments only at high concentrations. Furthermore, c-MET amplification and activations of a subset of tyrosine kinase receptors were observed in all three resistant cells. PHA665752, a c-MET inhibitor, remarkably increased the sensitivity of these resistant cells to afatinib (IC<sub>50</sub> = 12-123 nM). We established afatinib-resistant lung cancer cell lines and here report genes associated with afatinib resistance in human NSCLC.

Many studies hypothesized that ATC derives from Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma (DTC) through a de-differentiation process triggered by specific molecular events still largely unknown. E2F7 is an atypical member of the E2F family. Known as cell cycle inhibitor and keeper of genomic stability, in specific contexts its function is oncogenic, guiding cancer progression. We performed a meta-analysis on 279 gene expression profiles, from 8 Gene Expression Omnibus patient samples datasets, to explore the causal relationship between DTC and ATC. We defined 3 specific gene signatures describing the evolution from normal thyroid tissue to DTC and ATC and validated them in a cohort of human surgically resected ATCs collected in our Institution. We identified E2F7 as a key player in the DTC-ATC transition and showed in vitro that its down-regulation reduced ATC cells' aggressiveness features. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq profiling allowed the identification of the E2F7 specific gene program, which is mainly related to cell cycle progression and DNA repair ability. Overall, this study identified a signature describing DTC de-differentiation toward ATC subtype and unveiled an E2F7-dependent transcriptional program supporting this process.\",\n",

ICIs act upon T lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells, targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), breaking the immune tolerance of the T cells against malignant cells and enhancing the body's own immune response. A variety of cardiac-adverse effects are associated with ICI-based treatment, including pericarditis, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and acute coronary syndrome, with myocarditis being the most studied due to its often-unexpected onset and severity. Overall, Myocarditis is rare but presents an immune-related adverse event (irAE) that has a high fatality rate. Considering the rising number of oncological patients treated with ICIs and the severity of their potential adverse effects, a good understanding and continuous investigation of cardiac irAEs is of the utmost importance.

However, the results of long-term outcomes of (C)TRA are scarce in the literature, due to the rarity of such cases. The relative paucity of data prompts careful review of the available relevant series in order to critically evaluate this surgical technique from the oncologic and functional points of view.

English-language surgical series published between January 1985 and August 2021, reporting data on ≥5 patients treated for TC infiltrating the airway by (C)TRA were included. Oncologic outcomes, mortality, complications, and tracheotomy-dependency rates were assessed. Pooled proportion estimates were elaborated for each end-point. Thirty-seven studies were included, encompassing a total of 656 patients. Pooled risk of perioperative mortality was 2.0%. Surgical complications were reported in 27.0% of patients, with uni- or bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy being the most common. Permanent tracheotomy was required in 4.0% of patients. Oncologic outcomes varied among different series with 5- and 10-year overall survival rates ranging from 61% to 100% and 42.1% to 78.1%, respectively. Five- and 10-year disease specific survival rates ranged from 75.8% to 90% and 54.5% to 62.9%, respectively.

However, clinical studies have reported controversial results regarding the significance of the tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells/PD-L1 axis on the clinical picture and the response rate of patients with high-grade glial tumors to anti-cancer therapies. Herein, we conducted a systematic review according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statements to clarify the clinical significance of the tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells/PD-L1 axis and elucidate the impact of this axis on the response rate of affected patients to anti-cancer therapies. Indeed, a better understanding of the impact of this axis on the response rate of affected patients to anti-cancer therapies can provide valuable insights to address the futile response rate of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with high-grade glial tumors. For this purpose, we systematically searched Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and PubMed to obtain peer-reviewed studies published before 1 January 2021. We have observed that PD-L1 overexpression can be associated with the inferior prognosis of glioblastoma patients who have not been exposed to chemo-radiotherapy. Besides, exposure to anti-cancer therapies, e.g., chemo-radiotherapy, can up-regulate inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules in tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. Therefore, unlike unexposed patients, increased tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells in anti-cancer therapy-exposed tumoral tissues can be associated with the inferior prognosis of affected patients. Because various inhibitory immune checkpoints can regulate anti-tumoral immune responses, the single-cell sequencing of the cells residing in the tumor microenvironment can provide valuable insights into the expression patterns of inhibitory immune checkpoints in the tumor micromovement. Thus, administrating immune checkpoint inhibitors based on the data from the single-cell sequencing of these cells can increase patients' response rates, decrease the risk of immune-related adverse events development, prevent immune-resistance development, and reduce the risk of tumor recurrence.\",\n",

However, some limitations including the undefined cut-off value, poor uniformity of test platform, and weak reliability of prediction have restricted the broad application in clinical practice. In order to identify a clinically actionable biomarker and explore an effective strategy for prediction, we developed a genetic mutation model named as immunotherapy score (ITS) for predicting response to ICIs therapy in melanoma, based on whole-exome sequencing data from previous studies. We observed that patients with high ITS had better durable clinical benefit and survival outcomes than patients with low ITS in three independent cohorts, as well as in the meta-cohort. Notably, the prediction capability of ITS was more robust than that of TMB. Remarkably, ITS was not only an independent predictor of ICIs therapy, but also combined with TMB or LDH to better predict response to ICIs than any single biomarker. Moreover, patients with high ITS harbored the immunotherapy-sensitive characteristics including high TMB and NAL, ultraviolet light damage, impaired DNA damage repair pathway, arrested cell cycle signaling, and frequent mutations in NF1 and SERPINB3/4. Overall, these findings deserve prospective investigation in the future and may help guide clinical decisions on ICIs therapy for patients with melanoma.',\n",

For each inhibitor, a unique immunohistochemical assay was developed. This systematic review gives an up-to-date insight into the comparability of standardised immunohistochemical assays and laboratory-developed tests (LDTs), focusing specifically on tumour cell (TC) staining and scoring. A systematic search was performed identifying publications that assessed interassay, interobserver and/or interlaboratory concordance of PD-L1 assays and LDTs in tissue of NSCLC patients. Of 4294 publications identified through the systematic search, 27 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were of sufficient methodological quality. Studies assessing interassay concordance found high agreement between assays 22C3, 28-8 and SP263 and properly validated LDTs, and lower concordance for comparisons involving SP142. A decrease in concordance, however, is seen with use of cut-offs, which hampers interchangeability of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assays and LDTs. Studies assessing interobserver concordance found high agreement for all assays and LDTs, but lower agreement with use of a 1% cut-off. This may be problematic in clinical practice, as discordance between pathologists at this cut-off may result in some patients being denied valuable treatment options. Finally, five studies assessed interlaboratory concordance and found moderate to high agreement levels for various assays and LDTs. However, to assess the actual existence of interlaboratory variation in PD-L1 testing and PD-L1 positivity in clinical practice, studies using real-world clinical pathology data are needed.',\n",

Currently, all of the commercially available immunohistochemistry assays have been validated for use with histology specimens although, in routine clinical practice, approximately 30-40 % of patients with advanced NSCLC have only cytology specimens available for diagnosis, staging, and biomarker analysis. This systematic review evaluated the success rate, concordance, and clinical utility of using cytology specimens to assess tumor PD-L1 expression levels compared with histology specimens from patients with advanced NSCLC. EMBASE and PubMed database searches identified 142 unique, relevant publications, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria for at least one analysis. In 709 specimens, across seven publications, the proportion of cytology specimens evaluable for PD-L1 testing was 92.0 %. Among nine studies eligible for concordance analysis between cytology and histology specimens at a PD-L1 tumor cell expression cutoff of ≥50 %, overall percentage agreement was 89.7 % (n = 428), 72.0 % for positive percentage agreement (n = 218), and 95.0 % for negative percentage agreement (n = 258); results using a tumor PD-L1 expression cutoff of ≥1 % were similar. Our analyses suggest that using cytology specimens to assess PD-L1 expression is feasible, with good levels of concordance between cytology and histology specimens using PD-L1 tumor cell expression cutoffs of ≥1 % and ≥50 %. In conclusion, there is no convincing evidence that cytology specimens are inadequate or inferior to histology specimens for assessing PD-L1 expression in patients with NSCLC.',\n",

Information on study design, population characteristics, miRNA markers, and diagnostic accuracy (including sensitivity, specificity, and AUC) were independently extracted by two reviewers. Overall, 17 studies evaluating 35 circulating miRNA markers and 19 miRNA panels in serum or plasma were included. The median sensitivity (range) and specificity (range) were, respectively, 78.4% (51.7%-100%) and 78.7% (42.9%-93.5%) for individual miRNAs, and 83.0% (64.0%-100%) and 84.9% (71.0%-100%) for miRNA panels.
