              "['Introduction: Cervical cancer rates vary across the world, being highest in Eastern Africa (including Zimbabwe) and lowest in Western Asia. It is the second most common type of cancer in women in the South East Asia region and a major cause of cancer deaths among women of low and middle income countries (LMICs) like Nepal. This review is an attempt to make a comprehensive report of prevalence, incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in LMICs. Methods: The review was conducted applying a computerized search with the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) major topics “Cervical Cancer”, “Cervical neoplasm” “Epidemiology”, (“prevalence” OR “incidence” OR “mortality”) and “HPV” OR “Human papillomavirus” as MeSH subheading. The search limits were: language (“English”), LMICs, dates (articles published from “1st January 2000 to 31st December 2015”), and species (“Humans”). The search was supplemented by cross-referencing. Publications that met the inclusion criteria were included in the synthesis. Results: Among the 20 studies reviewed; seven were from Africa, seven from Asia, three from South America, and one each from North America, Europe and Oceania. The review found the highest reported age standardized incidence rate as 17.9/100,000/year in Zimbabwe in 2000 and the lowest as 0.11/100,000/year in China in 2006. One study of Nigeria revealed a cervical cancer prevalence of 5.0 per 1,000 in 2012 in the 25-64 year age group. Further, the highest reported age standardized mortality rate was 16/100,000/year in India in 2015 and the lowest 1.8/100,000/year in Colombia in 2013. In addition, coitarche, tobacco smoking, number of sexual partners and family history of cervical cancer were reported as significant risk factors. Conclusion: The study provides a review of reported prevalence, incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in LMICs from 1st January 2000 to 31st December 2015. The scarcity of information reveals a substantial need for further studies on cervical cancer prevalence, incidence and mortality with associated risk factors in LMICs.',\n",

              " 'The link between depression and anxiety status and cancer outcomes has been well-documented but remains unclear. We comprehensively quantified the association between depression and anxiety defined by symptom scales or clinical diagnosis and the risk of cancer incidence, cancer-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality in cancer patients. Pooled estimates of the relative risks (RRs) for cancer incidence and mortality were performed in a meta-analysis by random effects or fixed effects models as appropriate. Associations were tested in subgroups stratified by different study and participant characteristics. Fifty-one eligible cohort studies involving 2,611,907 participants with a mean follow-up period of 10.3 years were identified. Overall, depression and anxiety were associated with a significantly increased risk of cancer incidence (adjusted RR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.06-1.19), cancer-specific mortality (1.21, 1.16-1.26), and all-cause mortality in cancer patients (1.24, 1.13-1.35). The estimated absolute risk increases (ARIs) associated with depression and anxiety were 34.3 events/100,000 person years (15.8-50.2) for cancer incidence and 28.2 events/100,000 person years (21.5-34.9) for cancer-specific mortality. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that clinically diagnosed depression and anxiety were related to higher cancer incidence, poorer cancer survival, and higher cancer-specific mortality. Psychological distress (symptoms of depression and anxiety) was related to higher cancer-specific mortality and poorer cancer survival but not to increased cancer incidence. Site-specific analyses indicated that overall, depression and anxiety were associated with an increased incidence risks for cancers of the lung, oral cavity, prostate and skin, a higher cancer-specific mortality risk for cancers of the lung, bladder, breast, colorectum, hematopoietic system, kidney and prostate, and an increased all-cause mortality risk in lung cancer patients. These analyses suggest that depression and anxiety may have an etiologic role and prognostic impact on cancer, although there is potential reverse causality; Furthermore, there was substantial heterogeneity among the included studies, and the results should be interpreted with caution. Early detection and effective intervention of depression and anxiety in cancer patients and the general population have public health and clinical importance.',\n",

We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases. Articles were included if they reported the incidence and/or stage at diagnosis of cancer in people with psychotic disorders. Random effects meta-analyses were used to determine risk of cancer and odds of advanced stage cancer at diagnosis in people with psychosis, relative to those without psychotic disorders. A total of 40 articles were included in the review, of which, 31 were included in the meta-analyses. The pooled age-adjusted risk ratio for all cancers in people with psychotic disorders was 1.08 (95% CI: 1.01-1.15), relative to those without psychotic disorders, with significant heterogeneity by cancer site. People with psychotic disorders had a higher incidence of breast, oesophageal, colorectal, testicular, uterine, and cervical cancer, and a lower incidence of skin, prostate, and thyroid cancer. People with psychotic disorders also had 22% higher (95% CI: 2-46%) odds of metastases at diagnosis, compared to those without psychotic disorders. Our systematic review found a significant difference in overall cancer incidence among people diagnosed with psychotic disorders and people with psychotic disorders were more likely to present with advanced stage cancer at diagnosis.

In order to provide healthcare professionals and patients more guidance, a systematic literature review of the incidence of isolated IBTR and CBC in women diagnosed with early invasive breast cancer was performed. Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were searched from 2000 until October 2015. Multicenter studies reporting an IBTR or CBC rate in curatively treated adult females diagnosed with invasive breast cancer were included. The initial search yielded 6998 potentially relevant articles. Twenty were eligible for inclusion, representing 25 recurrence incidence rates. Both isolated IBTR and CBC incidence rates steadily increased with the length of follow-up, indicating that IBTR and CBC occur even more than 15 years after diagnosis. The annual incidence rate of isolated IBTR and CBC in women diagnosed with an early invasive breast cancer was 0.6% (range: 0.4-1.1%) and 0.5% (range: 0.2-0.7%), respectively. Analyzed data were lacking information about important risk factors and given treatment with regard to the incidence of recurrence, which hampers the prediction of patient tailored recurrence risks.

We included 29 observational prospective cohort studies with relative risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals for CRC according to various levels of processed meat consumption. Risk of bias was assessed using Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool. Data sources were PubMed and Embase up to January 2017. The summary relative risks for high versus low processed meat consumption and risk of CRC, colon, and rectal cancer were 1.13 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.26), 1.19 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.31), and 1.21 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.49), respectively.

The overall judgment showed that two out of 29 studies had a moderate risk of bias, 25 had a serious risk of bias, and 2 had a critical risk of bias. The bias domains most often rated critical were bias due to risk of confounding, bias due to missing data, and selective outcome reporting bias. Although this meta-analysis indicates a modest association between processed meat intake and an increased risk of CRC, our assessment of internal validity warrants a cautious interpretation of these results, as most of the included studies were judged to have serious or critical risks of bias.',\n",

Glucose could play a central role in metabolism and growth of many tumor types, and this possible mechanism is supported by the high rate of glucose demand and uptake in cancer. Thus, growing evidence suggests that hyperglycemia contributes to cancer progression but also to its onset. Many mechanisms underlying this association have been hypothesized, such as insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and increased inflammatory processes. Inflammation is a common pathophysiological feature in both diabetic and oncological patients, and inflammation linked to high glucose levels sensitizes microenvironment to tumorigenesis, promoting the development of malignant lesions by altering and sustaining a pathological condition in tissues. Glycemic control is the first goal of antidiabetic therapy, and glucose level reduction has also been associated with favorable outcomes in cancer. Here, we describe key events in carcinogenesis focusing on hyperglycemia as supporter in tumor progression and in particular, related to the role of a specific hypoglycemic drug class, sodium-glucose linked transporters (SGLTs). We also discuss the use of SGLT2 inhibitors as a novel potential cancer therapy. Our meta-analysis showed that SGLT-2 inhibitors were significantly associated with an overall reduced risk of cancer as compared to placebo (RR = 0.35, CI 0.33-0.37, P\\xa0=\\xa00. 00) with a particular effectiveness for dapaglifozin and ertuglifozin (RR = 0. 06, CI 0. 06-0. 07 and RR = 0. 22, CI 0. 18-0. 26, respectively).

In view of recent advances in data source linkage and analytical methods, we aimed to update the knowledge base on associations between location-specific cancer incidence and individual or area-level measures of socio-economic status (SES) among European adults. Materials and methods We systematically searched three databases (PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science) for articles on cancer incidence and SES. Qualitative synthesis was performed on the 91 included English language studies, published between 2000 and 2019 in Europe, which focused on adults, relied on cancer registry data and reported on relative risk (RR) estimates. Results Adults with low SES have increased risk of head and neck, oesophagogastric, liver and gallbladder, pancreatic, lung, kidney, bladder, penile and cervical cancers (highest RRs for lung, head and neck, stomach and cervix). Conversely, high SES is linked with increased risk of thyroid, breast, prostate and skin cancers. Central nervous system and haematological cancers are not associated with SES. The positive gap in testicular cancer has narrowed, while colorectal cancer shows a varying pattern in different countries. Negative associations are generally stronger for men compared to women. Conclusions In Europe, cancers in almost all common locations are associated with SES and the inequalities can be explained to a varying degree by known life-style related factors, most notably smoking.

Moreover, the effect of 5-ARI on cancer-specific mortality and progression of prostate cancer remains unclear. Therefore, the goal of the current meta-analysis was to elucidate the impact of 5-ARI on the incidence and progression of prostate cancer. We searched for all studies assessing the effect of 5-ARI on risk of prostate cancer in PubMed, Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Library databases. Pooled relative risk (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were accepted to evaluate the association between 5-ARI and the risk of prostate cancer. Synthetic results implied that subjects who accepted 5-ARI compared with the placebo group experienced a distinctly weakened overall incidence of prostate cancer (RR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.66-0.82; P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses further revealed that 5-ARI reduction of the incidence of prostate cancer was limited to low-grade (Gleason score 2-6; RR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.57-0.81; P < 0.001) and intermediate-grade tumors (Gleason score 7; RR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.67-0.97; P = 0.023), but not high-grade tumors (Gleason score >7; RR = 1.19; 95% CI: 0.98-1.43; P = 0.069).

MetS increased the risk of cancer-specific mortality (RR: 1.72, 1.03-2.42), but not overall mortality. The risk estimates of CRC incidence changed little depending on age, sex, cancer site, the type of studies, ethnicity, publication year, or definition of MetS. As for CRC mortality, further stratified analyses indicated statistical significance in studies with assessing cancer-specific survival outcome, in male, a cohort design, ethnicity of non-Chinese or with definition of MetS as ≥ 3 metabolic abnormalities. Obesity and hyperglycemia are risk factors of CRC incidence in both male and female.

Social support provided by marriage/relationship could promote a healthy lifestyle and an increased healthcare seeking behavior. We investigated the association between marital status and prostate cancer risk using data from the PRACTICAL Consortium. Pooled analyses were conducted combining 12 case-control studies based on histologically-confirmed incident prostate cancers and controls with information on marital status prior to diagnosis/interview. Marital status was categorized as married/partner, separated/divorced, single, or widowed. Tumours with Gleason scores\\u2009≥\\u20098 defined high-grade cancers, and low-grade otherwise. NCI-SEER's summary stages (local, regional, distant) indicated the extent of the cancer. Logistic regression was used to derive odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between marital status and prostate cancer risk, adjusting for potential confounders. Overall, 14,760 cases and 12,019 controls contributed to analyses. Compared to men who were married/with a partner, widowed men had an OR of 1.19 (95% CI 1.03-1.35) of prostate cancer, with little difference between low- and high-grade tumours. Risk estimates among widowers were 1.14 (95% CI 0.97-1.34) for local, 1.53 (95% CI 1.22-1.92) for regional, and 1.56 (95% CI 1.05-2.32) for distant stage tumours. Single men had elevated risks of high-grade cancers. Our findings highlight elevated risks of incident prostate cancer among widowers, more often characterized by tumours that had spread beyond the prostate at the time of diagnosis. Social support interventions and closer medical follow-up in this sub-population are warranted.\",\n",

A total of 30 cohort studies, including 1,660,795 patients were included in this study. Our study revealed that metformin treatment improves OS, CSS and RFS in PCa (HR\\u2009=\\u20090.72, 95% CI: 0.59-0.88, P\\u2009=\\u20090.001; HR\\u2009=\\u20090.78, 95% CI: 0.64-0.94, P\\u2009=\\u20090.009; and HR\\u2009=\\u20090.60, 95% CI: 0.42-0.87\\u2009P\\u2009=\\u20090.006, respectively) compared with non-metformin treatment.

Dose-response analysis showed a significant nonlinear association of GC risk with capsaicin intake (p<sub>non-linearity</sub> <0.05) and suggested a significant positive association between high chili consumption and GC risk (OR = 2.28, 95%CI = 1.76-2.96) but not moderate chili consumption (OR = 0.72, 95%CI = 0.36-1.41). Sensitivity analysis and publication bias test results indicated that no publication bias and the results were reliable (Egger's: <i>P</i>\\u2009=\\u20090.288). Evidence from this meta-analysis suggested that a higher level of chili consumption may be associated with an increased incidence of GC.

However, the extent of this impact depends upon the incidence of NIFTP in a given population. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to obtain robust information about the actual incidence of NIFTP worldwide by reviewing the published data. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Comprehensive literature search was performed using electronic databases of PubMed and Web of Science over a five-year period (January 1, 2016, to January 30, 2021). The incidence of NIFTP was calculated by dividing the number of NIFTPs by the number of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs). Meta-analysis of proportion and their 95% confidence interval [CI] were pooled using the random-effect model. Heterogeneity across the included studies was assessed using <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> statistics. Egger's regression test and funnel plot of estimates were used to evaluate the publication bias. <i>p</i>-Value <0.05 was considered significant. <b><i>Results:</i></b> From 505 publications, we included 50 studies, all retrospective, with 100,780 PTCs and 3990 NIFTP from 92 institutions worldwide. The overall incidence of NIFTP was 6.0% [CI 4.4-8.2] among PTCs or thyroid malignancies with a high level of heterogeneity among the included studies (<i>I</i><sup>2</sup>\\u2009=\\u200998.6%). NIFTP incidence was largely similar in North America and Europe (9.3% vs. 9.6%), with a significantly lower overall rate in Asia (2.1%). There was a significant decline in the reported incidence of NIFTP in non-Asian studies published after 2017 (<i>p</i>\\u2009=\\u20090.002). On applying our data on global thyroid cancer statistics, this reclassification would affect ∼30,881 patients annually, with a lower impact in Asia compared with North America and Europe. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> This comprehensive meta-analysis confirms that the worldwide NIFTP incidence is much lower than estimated initially. The NIFTP rates are significantly lower in Asian compared with North American and European countries. Apart from geography, NIFTP rates are significantly influenced by the nature of study, type of database used for sample collection, and the diagnostic criteria used.

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to determine the cancer risks at multiple sites for solid organ transplant recipients and their associations with tumor mutation burden (TMB), which reflects the immunogenicity. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Medline, and Cochrane Library was conducted. Random effects models were used to calculate the standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) versus the general population and determine the risks of different cancers. Linear regression (LR) was used to analyze the association between the SIRs and TMBs. Finally, seventy-two articles met our criteria, involving 2,105,122 solid organ transplant recipients. Compared with the general population, solid organ transplant recipients displayed a 2.68-fold cancer risk (SIR 2.68; 2.48-2.89; P <.001), renal transplant recipients displayed a 2.56-fold cancer risk (SIR 2.56; 2.31-2.84; P <.001), liver transplant recipients displayed a 2.45-fold cancer risk (SIR 2.45; 2.22-2.70; P <.001), heart and/or lung transplant recipients displayed a 3.72-fold cancer risk (SIR 3.72; 3.04-4.54; P <.001). The correlation coefficients between SIRs and TMBs were 0.68, 0.64, 0.59, 0.79 in solid organ recipients, renal recipients, liver recipients, heart and/or lung recipients, respectively. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that solid organ transplant recipients displayed a higher risk of some site-specific cancers, providing individualized guidance for clinicians to early detect, evaluate, and treat cancer among solid organ transplantation recipients. In addition, the increased cancer risk of solid organ transplant recipients is associated with TMB, suggesting that iatrogenic immunosuppression may contribute to the increased cancer risk in transplant recipients.

The reported incidence of osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the jaws following RT to the head and neck varies widely in the literature. Currently, for patients with head and neck cancer there are no universally accepted guidelines on the optimal timing of dental surgery relative to RT to minimise incident ORN. A literature review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) criteria. A search of PubMed, EMBASE, Evidence-Based Medicine, and Web of Science databases targeted literature published up to and including 10 April 2020. Two independent reviewers assessed studies for eligibility against inclusion criteria. An assessment of bias was conducted for each of the included studies and relevant data extracted. A meta-analysis was undertaken using the statistical methods described. Twenty-four of 708 studies were included. They were heterogeneous and included a wide variation of RT methods, head and neck malignancies, and comorbidities. While some concluded that the incidence of ORN was dependent on the timing of dental extractions in relation to RT, with regard to the risk of its development, others reported additional factors such as age, comorbidities, extent of surgical resection, and dose and field of radiation, as more important predictors than timing. In many there was consistent lack of detail around the timing of dental procedures in relation to the delivery of RT. From 21 studies including 36,294 patients, of whom 14,389 had extractions before RT, the pooled incidence of ORN was 5.5% (95% CI: 2.1% to 10.1%).

We noted that adjustment for body mass index (BMI) modified the relation of sedentary behavior to prostate cancer, particularly aggressive cancer. Sedentary behavior was related to a statistically significant increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer in analyses not adjusted for BMI (RR = 1.21; 95% CI, 1.03-1.43), whereas no association was apparent in BMI-adjusted analyses (RR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.90-1.07), and the difference between those summary risk estimates was statistically significant (<i>P</i> <sub>difference</sub> = 0.02). Sedentary behavior is not independently associated with prostate cancer. However, prolonged sedentary behavior may be related to increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer through a mechanism involving obesity. This finding represents a potentially important step toward considering sedentary behavior as a modifiable behavioral risk factor for aggressive prostate cancer.',\n",

Use of chemopreventive agents (CPAs) to reduce the incidence of precursor colorectal adenomas could lower the future burden of CRC. Many classes of potential CPAs have been investigated. To identify the most effective CPAs, we conducted a systematic review and a network meta-analysis (NMA). An electronic search was performed through August 2020 to identify all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of CPAs in reducing the incidence of colorectal adenomas at the time of surveillance colonoscopy among patients who had previously undergone polypectomy during an index colonoscopy. In total, 33 RCTs were included in the NMA, which was conducted under a Bayesian inference framework. Random effects models were used with adjustment for follow-up length and control group event rates to yield relative risks (RRs) and 95% credible intervals (CrIs). Our full network consisted of 13 interventions in addition to a placebo arm. Of 20,925 included patients, 7766 had an adenoma.

However, it is unclear if this association holds true in universal healthcare systems where screening, diagnostic, and treatment services are available to all patients. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence on the association of SES and melanoma incidence in Canada. A comprehensive search of PubMed and EMBASE yielded 7 studies reporting on melanoma incidence or outcomes with respect to SES in Canada. High SES was associated with increased melanoma incidence across all studies, which encompassed all Canadian provinces, and time periods spanning from 1979 to 2012. Studies also reported an increasing incidence of melanoma over time. There were substantial discrepancies in melanoma incidence across Canadian provinces, after controlling for SES and demographic characteristics. Populations of lower SES and living within certain healthcare regions had increased risks of advanced melanoma at diagnosis. This review highlights the potential for inequities in access to care even within a universal healthcare system.

Full texts of citations judged as potentially eligible were acquired by at least one of the two reviewers. Thereafter, both the reviewers used a standardised and pilot-tested form to independently screen every full text for eligibility. Methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the quality assessment tool for quantitative studies developed by the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP)Results After initial search of 1377 studies, thirty-eight articles were included in the analysis for systemic review including 32 case-control and six other design studies not limited to cross-sectional, observational, case-series, and screening. Finally, twenty-six case-control studies were included in the meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses of studies in meta-analysis showed the overall pooled estimate risk was (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.76 to 2.30, P <0.001).

However, the evidence on the relationships with different dietary fibre sources is mixed and little is known about which fibre source provides the greatest benefits. We conducted a dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohorts to summarise the relationships of different fibre sources with colorectal cancer and adenoma risks. Analyses were restricted to publications that reported all fibre sources (cereals, vegetables, fruits, legumes) to increase comparability between results. PubMed and Embase were searched through August 2018 to identify relevant studies. The summary relative risks (RR) and 95 % CI were estimated using a random-effects model. This analysis included a total of ten prospective studies. The summary RR of colorectal cancer associated with each 10 g/d increase in fibre intake were 0·91 (95 % CI 0·82, 1·00; I2 = 0 %) for cereal fibre, 0·95 (95 % CI 0·87, 1·03, I2 = 0 %) for vegetable fibre, 0·91 (95 % CI 0·78, 1·06, I2 = 43 %) for fruit fibre and 0·84 (95 % CI 0·63, 1·13, I2 = 45 %) for legume fibre. For cereal fibre, the association with colorectal cancer risk remained statistically significant after adjustment for folate intake (RR 0·89, 95 % CI 0·80, 0·99, I2 = 2 %). For vegetable and fruit fibres, the dose-response curve suggested evidence of non-linearity.

The most common neoplasm is gonadoblastoma, while others including dysgerminomas, yolk-sac tumors and teratomas are rare but can occur. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the incidences of these abnormalities and the circumstances surrounding these specific tumors.According to well-established methods, a PubMed systematic review was performed, to obtain relevant studies published in English and select those with the highest-quality data.Initially, the first search was performed using gonadal dysgenesis as the search term, resulting in 12,887 PubMed papers, published, from 1945 to 2017. A second search using ovarian germ cell tumors as the search term resulted in 10,473 papers, published from 1960 to 2017.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared safety profile of EGFR-TKIs with placebo were included. The end points included treatment-related adverse events (AEs), treatment discontinuation, and toxic death. Twenty-eight RCTs containing 17,800 patients were included. The analyses showed that the most frequently observed all-grade AEs in patients treated with EGFR-TKIs were diarrhea (53.7%), rash (48.6%), mucositis (46.5%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (38.9%), and skin reaction (35.2%). The most common high-grade (grade ≥3) AEs were mucositis (14.8%), pain (8.2%,), metabolism and nutrition disorders (7.4%), diarrhea (6.2%), dyspnea (6.1%), and hypertension (6.1%). The incidence of serious AEs, treatment discontinuation, and toxic death due to AEs were 18.2%, 12.36%, and 3.0%, respectively.

The prevalence rate of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which represents about 85% of kidney cancers, has been increasing gradually in many developed countries. Family history has been considered as one of the most relevant risk factors for kidney cancer, although most forms of an inherited predisposition for RCC only account for less than four percent. Lifestyle and other factors such as occupational exposure, high blood pressure, poor diet, and heavy cigarette smoking are highly associated with its incidence and mortality rates. In the United States, White populations have the lowest prevalence of RCC compared to other ethnic groups, while Black Americans suffer disproportionally from the adverse effects of RCC. Hence, this review article aims at identifying the major risk factors associated with RCC and highlighting the new therapeutic approaches for its control/prevention. To achieve this specific aim, articles in peer-reviewed journals with a primary focus on risk factors related to kidney cancer and on strategies to reduce RCC were identified. The review was systematically conducted by searching the databases of MEDLINE, PUBMED Central, and Google Scholar libraries for original articles. From the search, we found that the incidence and mortality rates of RCC are strongly associated with four main risk factors, including family history (genetics), lifestyle (poor diet, cigarette smoking, excess alcohol drinking), environment (community where people live), and occupation (place where people work). In addition, unequal access to improvement in RCC cancer treatment, limited access to screening and diagnosis, and limited access to kidney transplant significantly contribute to the difference observed in survival rate between African Americans and Caucasians. There is also scientific evidence suggesting that some physicians contribute to racial disparities when performing kidney transplant among minority populations. New therapeutic measures should be taken to prevent or reduce RCC, especially among African Americans, the most vulnerable population group.',\n",

The authors performed a meta-analysis of clinical trials aiming to evaluate the incidence and Relative Risk (RR) of developing all-grade and high-grade Hypertension Events (HE) in patients with solid tumors receiving targeted therapy.<b>Methods</b>: A review of citations from PubMed was performed and studies were selected based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The search was limited to randomized phase III trials published in English focused on the efficacy and safety of targeted agents in cancer patients, reporting data on HE. Incidence, RR and relative 95% CIs were analyzed using random or fixed-effects models. Overall incidences were calculated and further compared with the chi-squared test for proportions.<b>Results</b>: Ninety-three phase III trials were included, with a total of 68,077 patients. Prostate cancer was the most represented (18.9%), followed by breast cancer (17.3%) and colorectal cancer (16.4%). The incidence of all- and high-grade HE was 23.47% and 8.57%, respectively, with the highest incidence of serious HE reported by adjuvant Sunitib/Sorafenib (29.03%). The highest RR of high-grade HE was observed with Bevacizumab in patients with advanced cervical cancer. By drug category, the highest RR of high-grade HE was reported by VEGFR/EGFR TKIs.<b>Conclusion</b>: According to these data, monitoring this class of toxicities is of primary importance to avoid hypertension worsening and, thus, the risk of major cardiovascular events.',\n",

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), they account for only 2\\xa0% to 5\\xa0% of breast cancers. Their diagnosis relies on the presence of a neuroendocrine architecture and the expression of neuroendocrine markers (chromogranin A and/or synaptophysin). The revised 2012 WHO classification subdivides them into three categories: (i) well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas, (ii) poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas or small-cell carcinomas, and (iii) invasive breast carcinomas with neuroendocrine differentiation. Their clinical features and radiological characteristics are not different from those of other types of breast cancer. Because of discordant results, their clinical outcome is still poorly defined.

              " 'Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) results in long-term survival (≥10 years) in 85% of patients who survive transplant-related complications within the first 2 years posttransplant. Transplant survivors, however, are at an increased risk of chronic health conditions compared with the general population, including the emergence of secondary malignant neoplasms. In particular, female transplant survivors may face a greater risk of lower genital tract (cervical, vulvar, or vaginal) neoplasms due to chronic immune dysregulation in the peritransplant and posttransplant environment. Persistent immune suppression may facilitate the carcinogenesis of human papillomavirus (HPV), the causative agent of nearly all cervical cancers and most vulvar and vaginal cancers. Nevertheless, the risk of these cancers has not been sufficiently quantified in female transplant survivors. Small clinical studies have shown that the rate of cervical cytological abnormalities increases after allogeneic HCT, but large population-based studies have not consistently demonstrated an increased risk of secondary cervical cancer after transplant compared with the general population; the risk of developing secondary vulvar or vaginal cancer after transplant remains unclear. A better understanding of the natural history of HPV-associated lower genital tract neoplasms and their transplant-related risk factors would help delineate optimal long-term follow-up protocols in this population.

Conflicting DT incidences were seen after early versus late colectomy and when analysing open versus laparoscopic colectomy according to colectomy type. Three studies reported a (non-significantly) higher DT incidence after laparoscopic IPAA compared to laparoscopic IRA, with OR varying between 1.77 and 4.09.

Forty-one articles were included in this study (n = 7,122; n, number of patients). We identified two definitions of malignant progression: histologically proven (Htrans) and clinically defined (Ctrans). The malignant progression rate curves of Htrans and Ctrans were almost in parallel when constructed from the results of meta-regression by the mean follow-up time. The true transformation rate was supposed to lie between the two curves, approximately 40% at the 10-year mean follow-up. Risk of malignant progression was evaluated using hazard ratio (HR).

Smoking by HCT survivors has been reported to impact a variety of health outcomes, resulting in an increased risk for infections, cardio-pulmonary diseases, and cancer. The purpose of our study was to conduct a systematic literature search to determine the relationship between tobacco smoking pre-HCT and post-HCT outcomes. We conducted an electronic literature search from all languages from multiple peer-reviewed databases of studies that evaluated the effects of tobacco smoking prior to HCT on clinical outcomes. Data were extracted from the studies according to a strict selection criterion. Due to differences in primary endpoint and different populations evaluated in different studies, a meta-analysis was not possible, and a descriptive quantitative analysis is provided. Out of the 447 publications fulfilling the selection criteria for the electronic search, 17 articles were included in the final sample. The studies varied in terms of study design, patient characteristics, and HCT type. Considerable variability in definition of smoking was observed. We found that smoking pre-HCT was associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases, new infections, pulmonary complications, and cancers in comparison to non-smokers. Moreover, smoking pre-HCT was significantly associated with increased risks of both relapse and non-relapse mortality, and inversely related to median overall survival. Smoking adversely affects mortality in all HCT survivors by increasing the risks of both malignant and non-malignant complications. Thus, guidelines are urgently needed to formulate lifestyle factor modifications for HCT survivors focusing on smoking cessation strategies and abstinence maintenance in former smokers. Given the strength of these findings, guidelines should include systematic definitions of smoking for use in clinical trials as well as in standardized data reporting.',\n",

We conducted a systematic review of clinical and epidemiological studies investigating the effect of the irradiated volume or dose-volume distribution to the remaining volume at risk (RVR) on SPC incidence. We identified eighteen studies comparing SPC risks according to the irradiated volume (i.e., in most studies, the size or number of fields used), and four studies reporting risk estimates according to the dose distribution to the RVR (after whole-body dose reconstruction). An increased risk of SPCs (mainly breast and lung cancers) with extended radiotherapy was observed among patients treated for Hodgkin lymphoma or childhood cancers. However, normal tissue dose distribution was not estimated, limiting the interpretation of those results in terms of volume effects on organs at risk. Studies considering whole-body exposures quantified dose-response relationships for point dose estimates, without accounting for dose-volume distributions. Therefore, they disregarded possible tissue effects (e.g. bystander and abscopal effects, stem cell repopulation) which may play a role in the induction of SPCs. Currently, there is no clinical or epidemiological information about a possible role of high dose gradients in surrounding organs, or increasing volumes of distant tissues exposed to low doses, in the risk of SPCs. Opportunities for future research nevertheless now exist, since methods and tools for estimating individual whole-body dose-volume distributions in large patient populations have been developed.',\n",

A systematic review of the literature was conducted in January 2018 through a search of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and SCOPUS, alongside the screening of relevant reference lists. An initial search identified 746 potentially relevant studies. A total of 36 studies were included in the final review. Studies were categorized into one of the following categories: incidence/prevalence of POI, measurement of ovarian reserve, and other. Depending on patient characteristics, cancer diagnosis, and treatment, the prevalence of POI ranged from 2.1% to 82.2%. Risk factors for POI included exposure to alkylating agents and abdominal/pelvic radiation. POI may be associated with a number of complications, including low bone mineral density and poor cardiovascular health.

Bibliographic databases were searched through August 13, 2019, for observational studies of ICI therapy reporting the incidence and/or treatment of diarrhea or colitis. The primary outcome was ICI-associated diarrhea and colitis. Meta-analyses were performed with random-effects models. Twenty-five studies (N=12,661) were included. All studies had a high risk of bias in at least 1 domain. The overall incidence of diarrhea/colitis was 12.8% [95% confidence interval (CI), 8.8-18.2, I2=96.5].

The main outcomes were venous thromboembolism (VTE), stroke or systemic embolism (SE) and myocardial infarction (MI). Secondary outcomes were fatal VTE, fatal stroke or SE and fatal MI. Pooled proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random-effects models. A total of 59 trials, 25 in 5,578 patients with melanoma and 34 in 6,543 patients with NSCLC were included. In patients with melanoma, rates of VTE, stroke or SE and MI were 1.5% (95% CI 0.8-2.8), 1.7% (95% CI 0.8-3.7) and 0.4% (95% CI 0.2-0.9), respectively. In patients with NSCLC, corresponding rates were 1.9% (95% CI 1.2-3.2), 1.2% (95% CI 0.6-2.5), and 1.1% (95% CI 0.5-2.1), respectively. Rates of fatal VTE and MI were similar in melanoma and NSCLC patients. Rates of fatal stroke or SE were 1.9% (95% CI 0.4-9.5) and 0.7% (95% CI 0.2-2.3) in melanoma and NSCLC patients, respectively. Rates of VTE (3.1% vs. 1.1%) and myocardial infarction (3.4% Vs. 0.5%) were numerically higher in NSCLC patients treated with combined-ICIs vs mono-ICIs.

Methods We searched PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE and Web of Science databases for randomised controlled trials published until January 2017 that assessed patients with different types of cancer treated with or without tyrosine kinase inhibitors in addition to standard chemotherapy. Results A total of 29,252 patients from 71 randomised controlled trials were included.

In the pivotal placebo-controlled fracture trial of the RANKL inhibitor denosumab in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, treatment was associated with a lower incidence of non-fracture-related falls (p = 0.02). This ad hoc exploratory analysis pooled data from five placebo-controlled trials of denosumab to determine consistency across trials, if any, of the reduction of fall incidence. The analysis included trials in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis and low bone mass, men with osteoporosis, women receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer, and men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. The analysis was stratified by trial, and only included data from the placebo-controlled period of each trial. A time-to-event analysis of first fall and exposure-adjusted subject incidence rates of falls were analyzed. Falls were reported and captured as adverse events. The analysis comprised 10,036 individuals; 5030 received denosumab 60\\u2009mg subcutaneously once every 6\\u2009months for 12 to 36\\u2009months and 5006 received placebo. Kaplan-Meier estimates showed an occurrence of falls in 6.5% of subjects in the placebo group compared with 5.2% of subjects in the denosumab group (hazard ratio = 0.79; 95% confidence interval 0.66-0.93; p = 0.0061). Heterogeneity in study designs did not permit overall assessment of association with fracture outcomes. In conclusion, denosumab may reduce the risk of falls in addition to its established fracture risk reduction by reducing bone resorption and increasing bone mass. These observations require further exploration and confirmation in studies with muscle function or falls as the primary outcome. © 2020 The Authors.

Adequate and reproducible diagnosis of these precursor lesions is important. Diagnosing STIC can have prognostic consequences and is an absolute requirement for safely offering alternative risk reducing strategies, such as risk reducing salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy. However, diagnosing STIC is a challenging task, possessing only moderate reproducibility. In this review and meta-analysis, we look at how pathologists come to a diagnosis of STIC. We performed a literature search identifying 39 studies on risk reducing salpingo-oophorectomy in women with a known BRCA1/2 PV, collectively reporting on 6833 patients. We found a pooled estimated proportion of STIC of 2.8% (95% CI, 2.0-3.7). We focused on reported grossing protocols, morphological criteria, level of pathologist training, and the use of immunohistochemistry. The most commonly mentioned morphological characteristics of STIC are (1) loss of cell polarity, (2) nuclear pleomorphism, (3) high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, (4) mitotic activity, (5) pseudostratification, and (6) prominent nucleoli.

              " 'Chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment regimens for gastrointestinal, peritoneal and pelvic tumours can disrupt the intestinal microbiome and intestinal epithelia. Such disturbances can provoke symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy induced gastrointestinal toxicity aggravating intestinal microbiome dysbiosis is postulated to adversely alter the intestinal microbiome, with a consequent induced pro-inflammatory effect that disrupts the intestinal microbiome-epithelia-mucosal immunity axis. Although not widely recognised, the intestinal mucosa is the largest and most densely and dynamically populated immune-environment. Cancer treatment adverse effects that affect intestinal and mucosal cells inadvertently target and disrupt resident intestinal macrophages, the cells that marshal immune activity in the intestinal mucosa by shaping pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory activities to control and eradicate infectious insults and maintain local homeostasis. Pathobionts (bacteria capable of pathogenic pro-inflammatory activity) and noxious environmental and bacterial antigens use the intestinal epithelia and gap junctions as a point of entry into the systemic circulation. This translocation movement promotes toxic sequelae that obstruct intestinal macrophage functions resulting in uncontrolled local and systemic pro-inflammatory activity, loss of phagocytic function and loss of expression of tight junction proteins. Probiotic bacteria as an adjunctive treatment shows efficacy in ameliorating enteropathies such as mucositis/diarrhoea resulting from chemotherapy or radiotherapy regimens. As such we posit that an important benefit that warrants a further focused research effort is the administration of adjuvant probiotics to help reduce the incidence of febrile neutropenia.',\n",

Dried fruits are generally perceived, by both consumers and researchers, as a less attractive but shelf-stable equivalent to fresh fruits and constitute a small but significant proportion of modern diets. Chemical compositions of raw and dried fruits, however, may differ substantially. Several clinical and laboratory intervention studies have reported the protective effects of dehydrated fruits against the progression of some cancers and the modulating effects of dried fruits on common cancer risk factors. In this systematic review, we identified, summarized, and critically evaluated 9 prospective cohort and 7 case-control studies that examined the relations between traditional dried fruit (raisins, prunes, dates) consumption and cancer risk in humans. Prospective cohort studies determined that significant reductions in relative risk of precancerous colorectal polyps, incidence of prostate cancer, or mortality from pancreatic cancer, by, respectively, 24%, 49%, and 65%, were associated with 3-5 or more servings of dried fruits per week. Selected case-control studies revealed inverse associations between dried fruit intake and risk of cancer as well. The reported associations were comparable to or stronger than those observed for total or raw fruits. Although the small number and high heterogeneity impede meta-analysis of these studies, we conclude that currently available data provide some initial evidence that consumption of dried fruits may be associated with a lower cancer incidence or mortality in populations. The data suggest that higher intake of raisins and other dried fruits may be important in the prevention of cancers of the digestive system.

Data on liver status was available in 55.7% of all patients, with 46.1% having decompensated liver cirrhosis. These patients experienced more often treatment reductions and/or modifications, treatment side effects, and inferior survival than those with compensated cirrhosis (median 18 months vs. median not reached). Dose reductions and/or treatment modifications primarily due to concomitant liver disease were common. Moreover, liver toxicity was observed in 33.6% of patients with provided information on treatment side effects, ranging from mild toxicity to liver failure with fatal outcomes. Again, despite treatment modification/reduction, patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis developed hepatic toxicity more frequently than patients with compensated liver disease. Although patients suffering from cirrhosis and lymphoma can tolerate standard chemoimmunotherapy, a cautious multidisciplinary approach is needed to evaluate the risks and benefits.',\n",

A large number of studies have explored the relationship between PD-1, PD-L1, and different tumor susceptibility. However, these conclusions are not always consistent. Therefore, we updated this meta-analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE and other databases were searched systematically to obtain related research. Then, we used STATA15.0 software to carry out the final meta-analysis. The computational advantage is better than OR to evaluate this relationship. RESULTS A total of a total of 28 related studies were involved in our meta-analysis. It was found that PD-1 rs11568821 and rs7421861 increased the overall cancer probability in the allelic genetic model, while PD-1 rs36084323 effectively reduced the risk of cancer in the dominant genetic model. In the homozygous genetic model, PD-L1 rs17718883 effectively increased the probability of tumorigenesis. PD-L1rs4143815 is associated with a reduced incidence of cancer in heterozygote, homozygote and dominant genetic patterns. Subgroup analysis showed that PD-1rs2227981 can promote the susceptibility to breast cancer, while PD-1rs2227982 can reduce the susceptibility to breast cancer. PD-L1 rs2890658 can significantly reduce the risk of lung and liver cancer. CONCLUSIONS PD-1rs11568821, rs36084323, rs7421861, pD-L1rs17718883, and rs4143815 are associated with tumor susceptibility.

Medline, Cochrane, and Embase were searched for studies pertaining to radiation-induced skin toxicity in breast cancer patients. The search results were limited to randomized trials of external beam radiotherapy conducted in humans and reported in the English language. The primary outcome was the incidence or severity of radiation dermatitis. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed. A total of 96 studies were included in the present review. These evaluated the effect of different radiotherapy techniques, topical treatments, supplements, skin care regimens, and treatments on radiation dermatitis. Few topical agents and oral supplements demonstrated their effectiveness across the randomized trials; however, various radiotherapy techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, hypofractionated radiotherapy, accelerated partial breast irradiation, simultaneous integrated boost, and prone positioning consistently demonstrated decreased rates of radiation dermatitis, despite the limited number of studies in which they were evaluated.',\n",

The collection of lymphatic fluid (lymphocele) is the most common complication with potentially severe impact; therefore, different strategies have been proposed to reduce its incidence. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> In this systematic review, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and NIH Registry of Clinical Trials were searched for articles including the following interventions: transperitoneal <i>vs</i> extraperitoneal approach, any reconfiguration of the peritoneum, the use of pelvic drains, and the use of different sealing techniques and sealing agents. The outcome evaluated was the incidence of symptomatic lymphocele. Randomized, nonrandomized, and/or retrospective studies were included. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Twelve studies were included (including one ongoing randomized clinical trial). Because of heterogeneity of included studies, no meta-analysis was performed. No significant impact was reported by different sealing techniques and agents or by surgical approach. Three retrospective, nonrandomized studies showed a potential benefit of peritoneal reconfiguration to maximize the peritoneal surface of reabsorption. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Lymphocele formation is a multistep and multifactorial event; high-quality literature analyzing risk factors and preventive measures is rather scarce. Peritoneal reconfiguration could represent a reasonable option that deserves further evaluation; no other preventive measure is supported by current evidence.',\n",
              " 'Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Post-CRC resection complications and lower quality of life (QoL) are associated with a lower long-term survival. Perioperative administration of probiotics/synbiotics might lower prevalence of side effects and improve QoL and survival among CRC patients. Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane database, Embase, and clinical trials registries were searched in January 2020. Altogether, 16 randomized placebo-controlled probiotic/synbiotic clinical trials that included patients undergoing CRC surgery and investigated postoperative complications and QoL side effects were found. Meta-analyses using random-effects model were performed on data from 11 studies to calculate the effects of probiotics/synbiotics on common CRC resection postoperative side effects and complications. Perioperative probiotics/synbiotics administration was associated with lower infection incidence (odds ratio [OR] = 0.34, P < 0.001), lower diarrheal incidence (OR = 0.38, P < 0.001), faster return to normal gut function (mean difference [MD] -0.66 days, P < 0.001), shorter postoperative antibiotics use (MD -0.64 days, P < 0.001), lower incidence of septicemia (OR = 0.31, P < 0.001), and shorter length of hospital stay (MD -0.41 days, P = 0.110). The results support the hypothesis that short-term perioperative administration of probiotics/synbiotics, which are easy to administer, have few side-effects, and are low cost compared with alternatives, might help to alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms and postoperative complications among CRC patients.',\n",

Tertiary prevention aims to address a depressive episode that might still be present, is about to subside, or has recently resolved. We included tertiary prevention in the case where the focus was preventing the onset of depression in those with a history of depression (preventing recurrences) but excluded it if it specifically focused on maintaining an condition or implementing rehabilitation services (relapse prevention).

To obtain a comprehensive overview of the status of NAFLD over the past decade, we evaluated the epidemiology, risk factors, complications, and management of NAFLD in China through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Five English literature databases and three Chinese databases were searched for relevant topics from 2008 to 2018. A total of 392 studies with a population of 2,054,554 were included. National prevalence of NAFLD was 29.2%, with a heavier disease burden among the middle-aged, males, those in northwest China and Taiwan, regions with a gross domestic product per capita greater than 100,000 yuan, and Uygur and Hui ethnic groups. Currently, original studies on natural history and complications of NAFLD in China are scarce. Several studies revealed that NAFLD is positively correlated with the incidence of extrahepatic tumors, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. The Chinese population may have a higher hereditary risk of NAFLD due to more frequent nonsynonymous mutations in genes regulating lipid metabolism. Ultrasonography is the primary imaging tool in the detection of NAFLD in China. Serum tests and risk stratification algorithms for staging NAFLD remain under investigation. Specific pharmaceutical treatments for NAFLD are still undergoing clinical trials. It is noteworthy that the Chinese are underrepresented compared with their proportion of the NAFLD population in such trials.

The aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of exercise reported by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on physical function, physical fitness (ie, aerobic capacity, muscle strength) physical activity, and psychological well-being in older patients with CRC undergoing chemotherapy. Eight RCTs with 552 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The mean age across the RCTs was 58.5 years, and 2 RCTs excluded patients aged > 80 years. The meta-analyses showed a low level of evidence for a small beneficial effect of exercise on self-reported physical function (standardized mean difference [SMD], 0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04-0.48) and global quality of life (SMD, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.02-0.43) and low level of evidence for a moderate effect of exercise reducing fatigue (SMD,\\xa0-0.49; 95% CI,\\xa0-0.79 to\\xa0-0.19) for patients receiving chemotherapy for CRC.

The evidence for the effect of exercise on physical outcomes and psychological well-being during chemotherapy for patients with CRC and especially for older patients is sparse. However, exercise during chemotherapy for patients with CRC is feasible and safe. We found a moderate to high risk of bias in most of the included studies, small sample sizes, and a low number of included patients. Moreover, all studies had excluded patients with comorbidities or walking impairment, a group of patients who would probably benefit the most from exercise.

Cox regression estimated multivariable-adjusted HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations of the age at menarche with risk of each cancer in each cohort and random-effects meta-analysis was used to generate summary estimates for each cancer. Over a median 10 years of follow-up, 60,968 women were diagnosed with a first primary incident cancer. Inverse linear associations were observed for seven of 19 cancers studied. Each additional year in the age at menarche was associated with reduced risks of endometrial cancer (HR = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.89-0.94), liver cancer (HR = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85-0.99), melanoma (HR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93-0.98), bladder cancer (HR = 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99), and cancers of the colon (HR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99), lung (HR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99), and breast (HR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99).

MATERIAL AND METHODS A literature review and meta-analysis were performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Systematic literature searches were conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar up to February 2021. RESULTS Seventeen studies were included in the meta-analysis. The incidence of microvascular invasion was 49.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 43.8-54.5%) among PDAC patients who underwent surgery. The weighted multivariate Cox proportional hazards model hazard ratio for disease-free survival of 8 studies was 1.78 (95% CI 1.53-2.08, P<0.001), and there was no statistically significant difference between the subgroups (P=0.477).

Studies that applied the 2005 or 2015 NIH Consensus Criteria for the diagnosis and staging of chronic GVHD, and had a cohort size of at least 100 patients were included. Expert opinion: The authors found a wide variation of incidence rates, which can be explained by heterogeneity in the characteristics of study samples and applied transplantation protocols. Chronic GVHD was associated with higher non-relapse mortality (NRM), superior overall survival (OS) and lower risk of relapse. Studies indicated an increased risk for NRM and worse OS in the presence of more severe disease.

Analysing the risk factors, the odds ratios were 1.98 (95% confidence interval: 1.02-3.85) for liver disease; 3.62 (95% confidence interval: 2.83-4.65) for vertical localization (the upper portion of the stomach); 1.42 (95% confidence interval: 1.03-1.96) for resected size (>20 mm); 3.05 (95% confidence interval: 1.80-5.17) for depth of invasion (submucosal); 4.12 (95% confidence interval: 1.63-10.39) for operation time (>2 hours); 1.59 (95% confidence interval: 1.25-2.01) for gross type of lesion (depressed or flat); and 3.88 (95% confidence interval: 2.69-5.60) for piecemeal resection. Liver disease, vertical localization (the upper portion of the stomach), resected size (>20 mm), depth of invasion (submucosal), operation time (>2 hours), gross type of lesion (flat or depressed), and piecemeal resection were verified to be risk factors for perforation of gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection.',\n",

In this systematic review, we aimed to study the prevalence and risk factors of late-onset cardiomyopathy (LOCM) among survivors of childhood lymphoma treated with anthracyclines. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines we searched Pubmed/Medline, abstracted data and rated studies on quality regarding late-onset (>1 year following treatment) cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines in survivors of childhood lymphoma. Across 22 identified studies, the prevalence of anthracycline-induced LOCM among survivors of childhood lymphoma ranges from 0 to 40%. Anthracycline dose, administration and dose of mediastinal radiation, patient's age and era of diagnosis and evaluation, follow-up duration as well as disease relapse have been reported as risk factors for LOCM, whereas administration of dexrazoxane seems to act protectively. There was significant between-study heterogeneity with regards to lymphoma subtypes, follow-up duration, definition of outcomes, and anthracycline-based treatment protocols. The rates of anthracycline-induced LOCM among survivors of childhood lymphoma are high and dependent on study design. Future studies should explore whether modifying risk factors and suggested supportive care could decrease its prevalence among childhood lymphoma survivors. Until then, lifelong follow-up of these patients aiming to determinate the earliest signs of cardiac dysfunction is the most important measure towards primordial prevention of LOCM.\",\n",

              " \"Infections are estimated to cause approximately 15% of the world's cancers with large geographic variations. Yet, Canadian estimates for specific cancer-causing infections are not available. To estimate the number of infection-associated cancers diagnosed among Canadian adults in 2015, we calculated population attributable risks (PARs) and the number of attributable cases for seven carcinogenic infections and their 20 associated cancers. A systematic literature search was performed for each infection to obtain data on infection prevalence in the population and the relative risk or odds ratio associated with the cancer it causes. When mechanistic evidence suggested that detection of a given infection within cancer tissue was sufficient to attribute the cancer to the infection, prevalence among cancer cases was used to approximate the PAR. Data from 61 studies formed the basis of our analyses. The estimated number of infection-attributable cancer cases for 2015 was: 3828 for human papillomavirus (HPV), 2052 for Helicobacter pylori, 578 for Epstein-Barr virus, 509 for hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV), 100 for human herpesvirus type 8, and 30 cases for human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1. These seven infections were responsible for 3.7% of cancers diagnosed among Canadian adults in 2015; 3.5% among men and 4.0% among women. The infections with the highest number of attributable cases are largely preventable or treatable through vaccination (HBV and HPV), antibiotic therapy (H. pylori), or a combination of interventions (HCV), thereby representing an important target for reducing the infection-caused cancer burden among Canadians.\",\n",

The high incidence of cancer and salient ototoxic effects of platinum-based compounds pose a global public health threat. The purpose of this study was twofold. First, to estimate the prevalence of ototoxic hearing loss associated with treatment with cisplatin and/or carboplatin via a systematic review and meta-analysis. Second, to estimate the annual global burden of ototoxic hearing loss associated with exposure to cisplatin and/or carboplatin. For the systematic review, three databases were searched (Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection) and studies that reported prevalence of objectively measured ototoxic hearing loss in cancer patients were included. A random effects meta-analysis determined pooled prevalence (95% confidence intervals [CI]) of ototoxic hearing loss overall, and estimates were stratified by treatment and patient attributes. Estimates of ototoxic hearing loss burden were created with published global estimates of incident cancers often treated with platinum-based compounds and cancer-specific treatment rates. Eighty-seven records (n\\xa0=\\xa05077 individuals) were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled prevalence of ototoxic hearing loss associated with cisplatin and/or carboplatin exposure was 43.17% [CI 37.93-48.56%]. Prevalence estimates were higher for regimens involving cisplatin (cisplatin only: 49.21% [CI 42.62-55.82%]; cisplatin & carboplatin: 56.05% [CI 45.12-66.43%]) versus carboplatin only (13.47% [CI 8.68-20.32%]). Our crude estimates of burden indicated approximately one million individuals worldwide are likely exposed to cisplatin and/or carboplatin, which would result in almost half a million cases of hearing loss per year, globally. There is an urgent need to reduce impacts of ototoxicity in cancer patients. This can be partially achieved by implementing existing strategies focused on primary, secondary, and tertiary hearing loss prevention. Primary ototoxicity prevention via otoprotectants should be a research and policy priority.',\n",

Recent improvements in survival following a diagnosis of cancer have led to an increase in second primary cancers (SPCs) worldwide. Their aetiology remains largely unknown with a large proportion believed to be related to modifiable lifestyle factors. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published data that evaluated an association between cigarette smoking and risk of SPC. Studies were identified by searching Medline, Web of Science, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) and Scopus databases through March 2021 using broad search criteria. A meta-analysis was performed to derive pooled relative risks (RRs) for SPC defined a priori as smoking-related based on current evidence (lung, upper aero-digestive tract, stomach, pancreas, colorectum, liver, kidney, ureter, bladder and acute myeloid leukaemia). Eleven cohort studies and ten case-control studies met the eligibility criteria for review. There was marked heterogeneity in methods used in terms of classification and timing of smoking, confounders adjusted for and duration of follow-up across the studies. Nine cohort and seven case-control studies classified smoking habits prior to diagnosis of first cancer while the remaining studies classified post-first cancer smoking habits. In a meta-analysis using six studies, an increased risk of smoking-related SPC was observed for both former (RR=1.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-1.67) and current smoking (RR=2.76; 95% CI 2.29-3.33), compared with never smoking. The pooled RRs changed only slightly when studies which measured post-first cancer smoking were excluded. A two-fold increase in risk was observed for ever smoking compared with never smoking. In conclusion, there was evidence that smoking might increase the risk of SPC in cancer survivors. For better informed cancer survivorship practice guidelines, more studies are needed particularly of post-cancer smoking and for cancers not known to be caused by smoking.',\n",
              " \"The past decades have witnessed a rapid increase in the use of molecularly targeted therapies. One class of agents includes the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRIs), which afford patients longer progression-free survival (PFS) times, especially among non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC). Certain adverse effects, particularly skin toxicity, are mainly manifested as rash, xerosis, pruritus, nails changes, hair changes and mucositis. Previous studies reported the adverse events occurred based on the cutaneous inflammation reaction. Treatment recommended glucocorticoids and antibiotics. It is suggested that skin toxicity is an important issue because it usually affects patients' quality of life (QoL) and still causes dose reduction or discontinuation of targeted therapies. For these reasons, more and more oncologists and dermatologists recognize the importance of recognition and management of skin toxicities with the expansion in availability of EGFRIs. In this review, we conducted a systematic review of recent data to examine the types and frequencies of dermatologic toxicities associated with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapies in NSCLC and mCRC.

However, no previous study assessed the association of pre-diagnostic d-ROM measurements with cancer incidence. We measured serum d-ROM levels in a cohort sample of n = 4,345 participants of the German ESTHER study and in a case-cohort sample of the Norwegian Tromsø study (cancer cases: n = 941; subcohort: n = 1,000). Moreover, d-ROM was repeatedly measured at follow-ups of both studies. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were derived by (weighted) multivariable-adjusted Cox regression with time-dependent modeling of d-ROM levels for incident lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancer. Individual study results were pooled by random effects meta-analysis. The HRs (95% CI) for comparison of top and bottom d-ROM tertile were statistically significant for lung (1.90 [1.25-2.89]), colorectal (1.70 [1.15-2.51]) and breast cancer incidence (1.45 [1.01-2.09]) but not for prostate cancer incidence (1.20 [0.84-1.72]). In conclusion, this individual participant data meta-analysis of two large population-based cohort studies with repeated d-ROM measurements yielded evidence for an involvement of high oxidative stress in carcinogenesis. Given the observed associations of pre-diagnostic d-ROM measurements with lung, colorectal and breast cancer incidence, subjects with increased serum d-ROM levels should be recommended to reduce these levels by lifestyle changes including smoking cessation, a healthy diet and an increase in physical activity.',\n",

              " 'Gastroduodenal disease (GDD) was initially thought to be uncommon in Africa. Amongst others, lack of access to optimal health infrastructure and suspicion of conventional medicine resulted in the reported prevalence of GDD being significantly lower than that in other areas of the world. Following the increasing availability of flexible upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy, it has now become apparent that GDD, especially peptic ulcer disease (PUD), is prevalent across the continent of Africa. Recognised risk factors for gastric cancer (GCA) include <i>Helicobater pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>), diet, Epstein-Barr virus infection and industrial chemical exposure, while those for PUD are <i>H. pylori</i>, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-use, smoking and alcohol consumption. Of these, <i>H. pylori</i> is generally accepted to be causally related to the development of atrophic gastritis (AG), intestinal metaplasia (IM), PUD and distal GCA. Here, we perform a systematic review of the patterns of GDD across Africa obtained with endoscopy, and complement the analysis with new data obtained on pre-malignant gastric his-topathological lesions in Accra, Ghana which was compared with previous data from Maputo, Mozambique. As there is a general lack of structured cohort studies in Africa, we also considered endoscopy-based hospital or tertiary centre studies of symptomatic individuals. In Africa, there is considerable heterogeneity in the prevalence of PUD with no clear geographical patterns. Furthermore, there are differences in PUD within-country despite universally endemic <i>H. pylori</i> infection. PUD is not uncommon in Africa. Most of the African tertiary-centre studies had higher prevalence of PUD when compared with similar studies in western countries. An additional intriguing observation is a recent, ongoing decline in PUD in some African countries where <i>H. pylori</i> infection is still high. One possible reason for the high, sustained prevalence of PUD may be the significant use of NSAIDs in local or over-the-counter preparations. The prevalence of AG and IM, were similar or modestly higher over rates in western countries but lower than those seen in Asia. . In our new data, sampling of 136 patients in Accra detected evidence of pre-malignant lesions (AG and/or IM) in 20 individuals (14.7%). Likewise, the prevalence of pre-malignant lesions, in a sample of 109 patients from Maputo, were 8.3% AG and 8.3% IM. While H. pylori is endemic in Africa, the observed prevalence for GCA is rather low. However, cancer data is drawn from country cancer registries that are not comprehensive due to considerable variation in the availability of efficient local cancer reporting systems, diagnostic health facilities and expertise. Validation of cases and their source as well as specificity of outcome definitions are not explicit in most studies further contributing to uncertainty about the precise incidence rates of GCA on the continent. We conclude that evidence is still lacking to support (or not) the African enigma theory due to inconsistencies in the data that indicate a particularly low incidence of GDD in African countries.',\n",

Data of relevant epidemiological studies were collected by searching articles in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase till 29 June 2017. Random-effects models were employed to combine study-specific risks. Five cohort studies and nine case-control studies were included in our meta-analysis with 285\\u2009008 patients with diabetes mellitus and 4329 liver cancer cases. When we compared insulin-use group with noninsulin use group in patients with diabetes mellitus, we observed a statistically significant association between insulin therapy and liver cancer, with an overall relative risk of 1.90 (95% confidence interval: 1.44-2.50, I=76.1%). We did not find heterogeneity between subgroups stratified by study characteristics and adjusted confounders, except for subgroups related to 'follow-up years' of cohort studies. The combined estimate was robust across sensitivity analysis, and no publication bias was detected. Our results indicated that insulin therapy was associated with elevated incidence of liver cancer among diabetics.

Using these data, we conducted a meta-analysis of occupational styrene exposed workers and incidence of chromosome aberrations. Our meta-analysis used the standardized mean difference as the summary statistic since all studies assess the same outcome but use different comparison populations. The primary meta-analysis of the 20 comparisons of 505 styrene exposed workers to 532 comparison workers found a meta-mean difference of 0.361 (95 % CI -0.084 to 0.807, random effects model), but there was substantial lack of consistency across studies (I2 of 90.11, p-value <0.001, fixed effect model). Studies with higher styrene exposures had lower mean standard differences compared to studies with lower styrene exposures. While studies of styrene workers overall had a slight increase in chromosomal aberrations relative to comparison groups, the lack of consistency across studies and the absence of an exposure response and other limitations of the reviewed studies including inadequate exposure assessment, small numbers of participants per study, and poorly matched exposed and comparison workers, we find insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that styrene exposure increases chromosome aberration frequencies in styrene workers.',\n",

Sixteen SNPs were statistically associated with risk of 17 cancers. We graded the cumulative epidemiological evidence as strong for statistical associations between 10 SNPs in 8 miRNAs and risk of 11 cancers, moderate for 9 SNPs with 12 cancers and weak for 11 SNPs with 11 cancers. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the SNPs with strong evidence might fall in putative functional regions.

In this study, we aimed to assess the causality of these associations through a Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Single nucleotide polymorphisms of diet-derived circulating antioxidants (i.e., α- and γ-tocopherol, ascorbate, retinol, β-carotene, lycopene, and urate), accessed by absolute levels and relative metabolite concentrations, were used as genetic instruments. Summary statistics for digestive system cancers were obtained from the UK Biobank and FinnGen studies. Two-sample MR analyses were performed in each of the two outcome databases, followed by a meta-analysis. The inverse-variance weighted MR was adopted as the primary analysis. Five additional MR methods (likelihood-based MR, MR-Egger, weighted median, penalized weighted median, and MR-PRESSO) and replicate MR analyses for outcomes from different sources were used as sensitivity analyses. Genetically determined antioxidants were not significantly associated with five digestive system cancers, after correcting for multiple tests. However, we found suggestive evidence that absolute ascorbate levels were negatively associated with colon cancer in UK Biobank-the odds ratio (OR) per unit increase in ascorbate was 0.774 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.608-0.985, <i>p</i> = 0.037), which was consistent with the results in FinnGen, and the combined OR was 0.764 (95% CI 0.623-0.936, <i>p</i> = 0.010). Likewise, higher absolute retinol levels suggestively reduced the pancreatic cancer risk in FinnGen-the OR per 10% unit increase in ln-transformed retinol was 0.705 (95% CI 0.529-0.940, <i>p</i> = 0.017), which was consistent with the results in UK Biobank and the combined OR was 0.747 (95% CI, 0.584-0.955, <i>p</i> = 0.020).

We conducted a meta-analysis of proportion to estimate the pooled incidence of TA-TMA using a random-effects model. We assessed moderators of heterogeneity through subgroup analysis, risk of bias through ROBINS-I, and publication bias through funnel plot. Among 21 cohort studies with a total of 36,163 adult and pediatric patients who underwent allogeneic transplantation, the pooled incidence of TA-TMA was 12% (95% confidence interval, 9% to 16%). The diagnostic criteria used to define the disease was the most significant contributor identified to the high interstudy heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>\\xa0=\\xa098%). Studies using provider/clinician diagnosis instead of laboratory diagnosis reported the lowest incidence, at 3%. The most salient risk factor for TA-TMA reported in 14 studies was preceding acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

Methods and Results Individual-level data of 29\\xa0288 Japanese individuals aged 40 to 74\\xa0years without a history of CVD from 10 prospective cohort studies were used. Metabolic syndrome was defined as the presence of high abdominal obesity and/or overweight plus risk factors such as high blood pressure, high triglyceride or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and high blood glucose levels. The risk categories for lifestyle intervention were information supply only, motivation-support intervention, and intensive support intervention. Sex- and age-specific hazard ratios and population attributable fractions of CVD, which were also further adjusted to consider non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, were estimated with reference to nonobese/overweight individuals, using Cox proportional hazard regression. Since the reference category included those with risk factors, we set a supernormal group (nonobese/overweight with no risk factor) as another reference. We documented 1023 incident CVD cases (565 men and 458 women). The adjusted CVD risk was 60% to 70% higher in men and women aged 40 to 64\\xa0years receiving an intensive support intervention, and 30% higher in women aged 65 to 74\\xa0years receiving a motivation-support intervention, compared with nonobese/overweight individuals.

To provide an up-to-date quantification of the role of aspirin on lung, breast, endometrium, ovary, prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all observational studies published up to March 2019. We estimated pooled relative risk (RR) of cancer or cancer death for regular aspirin use vs non-use by using random-effects models, and, whenever possible, we investigated dose- and duration-risk relations.

Regular aspirin use was associated to a reduced risk of lung (RR = 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.79-0.98), breast (RR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.85-0.95), endometrial (RR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.84-0.98), ovarian (RR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.85-0.97) and prostate (RR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.89-0.96) cancer. However, for most neoplasms, nonsignificant risk reductions were reported in cohort and nested case-control studies and there was between-study heterogeneity.

Fifty-four studies met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated utilising a quality assessment tool for ecological studies. High population density appears to be associated with higher mortality rates of a range of cancers, cardiovascular disease and COPD, and a higher incidence of a range of cancers, asthma and club foot. In contrast, diabetes incidence was found to be associated with low population density. High and low population density are therefore risk markers for a range of NCDs, indicating that there are unidentified factors and mechanisms underlying aetiology. On closer examination, our synthesis revealed important and complex relationships between population density, the built environment, the nature of greenspace and man-made exposures. In light of increasing rates of morbidity and mortality, future research is required to investigate these associations in order to establish causative agents for each NCD.',\n",

Given this wealth of information, selecting a single \"best\" study on which to base dose-response analyses is difficult and would potentially ignore much of the available data. Therefore, systematic approaches are necessary for the analysis of these rich databases. Examples are meta-analysis (and further, meta-regression), which are well established methods that consider and incorporate information from multiple studies into the estimation of risks due to exposure to environmental contaminants. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical, Bayesian meta-analysis approach for the dose-response analysis of multiple epidemiological studies. This paper is the second of two papers detailing this approach; the first covered \"pre-analysis\" steps necessary to prepare the data for dose-response modeling. This paper focuses on the hierarchical Bayesian approach to dose-response modeling and extrapolation of risk to populations of interest using the association between bladder cancer and oral inorganic arsenic (iAs) exposure as an illustrative case study. In particular, this paper addresses the modeling of both case-control and cohort studies with a flexible, logistic model in a hierarchical Bayesian framework that estimates study-specific slopes, as well as a pooled slope across all studies. This approach is akin to a random effects model in which no assumption is made a priori that there is a single, common slope for all included studies. Further, this paper also details extrapolation of the estimates of logistic slope to extra risk in a target population using a lifetable analysis and basic assumptions about background iAs exposure levels. In this case, the target population was the general United States population and information on all-cause mortality and incidence and mortality from bladder cancer was used to perform the lifetable analysis. The methods herein were developed for general use in investigating the association between any pollutant and observed health-effects in epidemiological studies. In order to demonstrate these methods, inorganic arsenic was chosen as a case study given the large epidemiological database that exists for this contaminant.',\n",

Gastric cancer was the world's third leading cause of cancer mortality in 2012, responsible for 723,000 deaths, 8.8% of total cancer deaths. <sup>1</sup> In 2017, 28,000 new cases and 10,960 deaths are estimated for gastric cancer in the United States. <sup>2</sup> Estimated United States prevalence counts on January 1, 2014, for patients diagnosed within the previous 5-years was 48,271 (SEER Cancer Statistics Review-2014). Prognostic indices of survival & mortality in patients with gastric cancer are related to tumor stage including nodal involvement, direct tumor extension beyond the gastric wall, and wide-spread dissemination. Tumor histologic grade (degree of loss of cellular differentiation), and oncotype-specific ICD-O-3 phenotypes also provides important prognostic information. By more than 90%, the most common histologic type of stomach cancer is adenocarcinoma. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) ICD-O-3 SEER Site/Histology Validation List catalog (September 18, 2015) enumerates almost 200 subtypes for gastric cancer sites C160-C166, C168-C169. Based on the results of molecular evaluation of 295 primary gastric adenocarcinomas reported to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project in 2014, a novel classification separating gastric cancers into four subtypes according to Epstein-Barr virus positive status, microsatellite instability, chromosomal instability, or genomic stability was proposed. <sup>3</sup> Of interest, <i>Helicobacter Pylori</i> infection and its role in the development of gastric cancer is not mentioned.

Survival statistics were derived from: SEER*Stat Database: Incidence\\xa0- SEER 9 Regs Research Data, November 2016 Submission (1973-2014) <Katrina/Rita Population Adjustment> Released April 2017. <b>Results.</b>-By more than 90%, the most common type of stomach cancer is adenocarcinoma. From 1975 to 2014, gastric cancer incidence has been steadily decreasing in the United States at the rate of -1.5% per year. In a total of 157,258 cases of invasive staged cancer of the stomach, mean age in males was 67.5 years, females 69.6\\xa0years, both male & female 67.4 years. Greater than 90% of cases occurred between ages 45-85+ years with the zenith in males at 70-74 years (15.1%) and 85+ years in females (17.9%). The overall annual US death rate per 100,000 per year for stomach cancer from 1975 to 2014 has decreased from 5.1 to 3.1, but excess mortality at 0-5 years remains exceedingly high. Mortality is a function of incidence and survival, and unfortunately, almost all of this decrease is due to the decrease in incidence of stomach cancer. Of the 157,258 invasive cases, 86.6% were clinically staged and 76.8% were histologically graded. <b>Conclusions.</b>-Given the histologic and etiologic heterogeneity of gastric cancer, major improvements in mortality and survival outcomes await the development of diagnostic markers for earlier diagnosis, and genomic sequencing and identification of chromosomal aberrations, nucleotide substitutions and epigenetic modifications that drive malignant transformation, for the development of targeted therapies for almost 200 gastric cancer subtypes.\",\n",

Analysis stratified by follow-up time, cancer types, analysis types, sample sizes and cut off further verified the prognostic value of SNHG7. Additionally, elevated SNHG7 expression was correlated with TNM stage (OR: 3.31, 95%CI = 2.29-4.80, P = 0.000), lymph node metastasis (OR = 3.32, 95%CI = 1.61-6.83, P = 0.004), and tumor differentiation (OR = 1.92, 95%CI = 1.22-3.03, P =0.005) in patients with cancers. Excavation of TCGA dataset valuated that SNHG7 was upregulated in some cancers and predicted worse OS, which partially confirmed our results in this meta-analysis.',\n",

We updated a systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2015 to May 2019 to provide quantitative information on GI/GL and cancer risk. Relative risks (RR) and the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the highest versus the lowest categories of GI and GL were extracted from selected studies and pooled using random-effects models. Twenty reports (>22,000 cancer cases) have become available after January 2015, and 15 were added to the meta-analyses by cancer sites, which considered a total of 88 investigations. The five additional reports were reviewed, but not included in the meta-analyses, since data were inadequate to be pooled. For hormone-related cancers, summary RRs for the highest versus lowest GI and GL intakes were moderately increased. They ranged from 1.04 (breast) to 1.12 (endometrium) for GI and from 1.03 (prostate) to 1.22 (ovary) for GL, of borderline significance. High GI was associated with small increased risks of colorectal (summary RR for GI: 1.20, 95% CI, 1.07-1.34-GL: 1.09, 95% CI, 0.97-1.22, 19 studies), bladder (GI: 1.25, 95% CI, 1.11-1.41-GL: 1.10, 95% CI, 0.85-1.42, four studies) and kidney cancers (GI: 1.16, 95% CI, 1.02-1.32-GL: 1.14, 95% CI, 0.81-1.60, five studies). GL was not significantly related to those cancer sites. Stomach, prostate and lung cancers were not associated with GI and GL. The present analysis, based on an updated comprehensive evaluation of the epidemiological literature, indicates moderate unfavorable effects of high versus low GI on colorectal, and possibly bladder and kidney cancers, and a possible moderate positive association between GL and endometrial cancer.',\n",

We conducted the first systematic literature review of studies published before December 2020 using the PubMed database to summarize the current evidence on whether dietary factors for cancer may differ by individuals carrying C (common) and/or G (minor) alleles of the <i>PPARG2</i> Pro12Ala allele polymorphism. The inclusion criteria were observational studies that investigated the association between food or nutrient consumption and risk of incident cancer stratified by <i>PPARG2</i> Pro12Ala allele polymorphism. From 3815 identified abstracts, nine articles (18,268 participants and 4780 cancer cases) covering three cancer sites (i.e., colon/rectum, prostate, and breast) were included. CG/GG allele carriers were more impacted by dietary factors than CC allele carriers. High levels of protective factors (e.g., carotenoids and prudent dietary patterns) were associated with a lower cancer risk, and high levels of risk factors (e.g., alcohol and refined grains) were associated with a higher cancer risk. In contrast, both CG/GG and CC allele carriers were similarly impacted by dietary fats, well-known PPAR-γ agonists. These findings highlight the complex relation between <i>PPARG2</i> Pro12Ala allele polymorphism, dietary factors, and cancer risk, which warrant further investigation.',\n",
              " 'Whether thyroid dysfunction plays a causal role in the development of cancer remains inconclusive. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization study to investigate the associations between genetic predisposition to thyroid dysfunction and 22 site-specific cancers. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with four traits of thyroid function were selected from a genome-wide association meta-analysis with up to 72,167 European-descent individuals. Summary-level data for breast cancer and 21 other cancers were extracted from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (122,977 breast cancer cases and 105,974 controls) and UK Biobank (367,643 individuals). For breast cancer, a meta-analysis was performed using data from both sources. Genetically predicted thyroid dysfunction was associated with breast cancer, with similar patterns of associations in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium and UK Biobank. The combined odds ratios of breast cancer were 0.94 (0.91-0.98; p = 0.007) per genetically predicted one standard deviation increase in TSH levels, 0.96 (0.91-1.00; p = 0.053) for genetic predisposition to hypothyroidism, 1.04 (1.01-1.07; p = 0.005) for genetic predisposition to hyperthyroidism and 1.07 (1.02-1.12; p = 0.003) per genetically predicted one standard deviation increase in free thyroxine levels. Genetically predicted TSH levels and hypothyroidism were inversely with thyroid cancer; the odds ratios were 0.47 (0.30-0.73; p = 0.001) and 0.70 (0.51-0.98; p = 0.038), respectively. Our study provides evidence of a causal association between thyroid dysfunction and breast cancer (mainly ER-positive tumors) risk. The role of TSH and hypothyroidism for thyroid cancer and the associations between thyroid dysfunction and other cancers need further exploration.',\n",

The role of <i>LOX</i> in carcinogenesis prompted several association studies in various cancer types; however the outcomes of these studies have inconsistent. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis to obtain more precise estimates. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> A literature search yielded 14 articles from which we examined five cancer groups: breast, bone, lung, gastrointestinal, and gynecological cancers. For each cancer group, pooled odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using standard genetic models. High significance (<i>p</i>-value for association [<i>p</i><sup>a</sup>] < 0.00001), homogeneity (<i>I</i><sup>2</sup>\\u2009=\\u20090%), and high precision of effects (CI difference [CID] <1.0 [upper CI - lower CI]) comprised the three criteria for strength of evidence. We used sensitivity analysis to assess robustness of the outcomes. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We generated 28 comparisons from which 13 were significant (<i>p</i><sup>a</sup> < 0.05), indicating increased risk, (OR >1.00) found in all cancer groups except breast (<i>p</i><sup>a</sup>\\u2009=\\u20090.10-0.91). Of the 13, three met all criteria (core) for strength of evidence (<i>p</i><sup>a</sup> < 0.00001, CIDs 0.49-0.56 and <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>\\u2009=\\u20090%), found in dominant/codominant models of gynecological cancers (ORs 1.52-1.62, 95% CIs 1.26-1.88) and codominant model of lung cancer (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.19-1.74). These three were deemed robust. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Based on the three core outcomes, associations of <i>LOX</i> 473G/A with lung, ovarian, and cervical cancers indicate 1.4-1.6-fold increased risks, underpinned by robustness and high statistical power at the aggregate level.',\n",
