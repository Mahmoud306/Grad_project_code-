              "['Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide. Lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has been shown to reduce lung cancer specific mortality. In 2013, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended annual lung cancer screening with LDCT for smokers aged between 55 years to 80 years, with at least 30 pack-years of smoking exposure that currently smoke or who have quit smoking within 15 years. Risk-based lung cancer screening is an alternative approach that defines screening eligibility based on the personal risk of individuals. Selection of individuals for lung cancer screening based on their personal lung cancer risk has been shown to improve the sensitivity and specificity associated with the eligibility criteria of the screening program as compared to the 2013 USPSTF criteria. Numerous risk prediction models have been developed to estimate the lung cancer risk of individuals incorporating sociodemographic, smoking, and clinical risk factors associated with lung cancer, including age, smoking history, sex, race/ethnicity, personal and family history of cancer, and history of emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), among others. Some risk prediction models include biomarker information, such as germline mutations or protein-based biomarkers as independent risk predictors, in addition to clinical, smoking, and sociodemographic risk factors. While, the majority of lung cancer risk prediction models are suitable for selecting high-risk individuals for lung cancer screening, some risk models have been developed to predict the probability of malignancy of screen-detected solidary pulmonary nodules or to optimize the screening frequency of eligible individuals by incorporating past screening findings. In this systematic review, we provide an overview of existing risk prediction models and their applications to lung cancer screening. We discuss potential strengths and limitations of lung cancer screening using risk prediction models and future research directions.',\n",

In this study, we established a 3-subtype cluster with low (C<sub>LIM</sub>), medium (C<sub>MIM</sub>), and high (C<sub>HIM</sub>) enrichment of immune signatures based on immunogenomic profiling. We validated the classification in multiple independent datasets. The C<sub>HIM</sub> subtype exhibited a relatively better prognosis and showed features of \"hot tumors\", including low tumor purity, high stromal components, overexpression of immune checkpoint molecules, and enriched tumor-infiltrated immune cells (activated T cells and macrophages). In addition, C<sub>HIM</sub> tumors were also characterized by frequent <i>ARID1A</i> mutation, rare <i>TP53</i> mutation, hypermethylation status, and altered protein expression (HER2, β-catenin, Cyclin E1, PREX1, LCK, PD-L1, Transglutaminase, and cleaved Caspase 7). By Gene Set Variation Analysis, \"TGFβ signaling pathway\" and \"GAP junction\" were enriched in C<sub>LIM</sub> tumors and inversely correlated with CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration. Of note, the C<sub>HIM</sub> patients showed a higher response rate to immunotherapy (44.4% vs. 11.1% and 16.7%) and a more prolonged progression-free survival (4.83 vs. 1.86 and 2.75 months) than C<sub>MIM</sub> and C<sub>LIM</sub> patients in a microsatellite-independent manner.

Gastric cancer was the world's third leading cause of cancer mortality in 2012, responsible for 723,000 deaths, 8.8% of total cancer deaths. <sup>1</sup> In 2017, 28,000 new cases and 10,960 deaths are estimated for gastric cancer in the United States. <sup>2</sup> Estimated United States prevalence counts on January 1, 2014, for patients diagnosed within the previous 5-years was 48,271 (SEER Cancer Statistics Review-2014). Prognostic indices of survival & mortality in patients with gastric cancer are related to tumor stage including nodal involvement, direct tumor extension beyond the gastric wall, and wide-spread dissemination. Tumor histologic grade (degree of loss of cellular differentiation), and oncotype-specific ICD-O-3 phenotypes also provides important prognostic information. By more than 90%, the most common histologic type of stomach cancer is adenocarcinoma. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) ICD-O-3 SEER Site/Histology Validation List catalog (September 18, 2015) enumerates almost 200 subtypes for gastric cancer sites C160-C166, C168-C169. Based on the results of molecular evaluation of 295 primary gastric adenocarcinomas reported to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project in 2014, a novel classification separating gastric cancers into four subtypes according to Epstein-Barr virus positive status, microsatellite instability, chromosomal instability, or genomic stability was proposed. <sup>3</sup> Of interest, <i>Helicobacter Pylori</i> infection and its role in the development of gastric cancer is not mentioned. All cancer has a genetic basis. However, given the histologic and etiologic heterogeneity of gastric cancer, eventual comprehensive molecular characterization and genomic sequencing with identification of chromosomal aberrations, nucleotide substitutions mortality follow-up study is focused on short- and long-term comparative patient outcomes of stomach adenocarcinoma, ICD-O-3 8140-8147, and other selected gastric cancer oncotypes. <b>Objective.</b>-To update trends in incidence, prevalence, short- and long-term survival, and mortality of gastric cancer using the statistical database of SEER*Stat 8.3.4 for diagnosis years 1973-2014 employing multiple case selection variables. <b>Methods.</b>-A retrospective, population-based study using nationally representative data from the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program to evaluate 157,258 cases for diagnosis years 1973-2014 comparing multiple variables of age, sex, race, stage, grade, cohort entry time-period, disease duration and histologic oncotype: Relative survival statistics were analyzed in two cohorts: 1973-1994 and 1995-2014. Survival statistics were derived from: SEER*Stat Database: Incidence\\xa0- SEER 9 Regs Research Data, November 2016 Submission (1973-2014) <Katrina/Rita Population Adjustment> Released April 2017. <b>Results.</b>-By more than 90%, the most common type of stomach cancer is adenocarcinoma. From 1975 to 2014, gastric cancer incidence has been steadily decreasing in the United States at the rate of -1.5% per year. In a total of 157,258 cases of invasive staged cancer of the stomach, mean age in males was 67.5 years, females 69.6\\xa0years, both male & female 67.4 years. Greater than 90% of cases occurred between ages 45-85+ years with the zenith in males at 70-74 years (15.1%) and 85+ years in females (17.9%). The overall annual US death rate per 100,000 per year for stomach cancer from 1975 to 2014 has decreased from 5.1 to 3.1, but excess mortality at 0-5 years remains exceedingly high. Mortality is a function of incidence and survival, and unfortunately, almost all of this decrease is due to the decrease in incidence of stomach cancer. Of the 157,258 invasive cases, 86.6% were clinically staged and 76.8% were histologically graded. <b>Conclusions.</b>-Given the histologic and etiologic heterogeneity of gastric cancer, major improvements in mortality and survival outcomes await the development of diagnostic markers for earlier diagnosis, and genomic sequencing and identification of chromosomal aberrations, nucleotide substitutions and epigenetic modifications that drive malignant transformation, for the development of targeted therapies for almost 200 gastric cancer subtypes.\",\n",

However, these patients continue to have a high risk of recurrence and death. Unfortunately, there has been little progress in the treatment of resectable NSCLC over the past several decades. Neoadjuvant therapy, which has been considered as an approach to improve survival in patients with resectable NSCLC, is a hotly debated topic. A systematic review of 32 randomized trials involving 10,000 patients revealed that there was no difference in survival between preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy. Because of such results and the theoretical concern about resectable tumors progressing on relatively ineffective neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and thus becoming unresectable, neoadjuvant chemotherapy fell out of favor, and many clinicians preferred adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. However, neoadjuvant therapy has been revived in the past couple of years, with emerging data from various ongoing trials suggesting that neoadjuvant immunotherapy may have significant efficacy and could potentially improve the survival of patients with resectable NSCLC. In this review article, we discuss the evidence supporting the role of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in the multimodal management of resectable NSCLC.

As more extensive research and clinical trials are conducted, resistance to TRAIL molecule has become one of the significant issues associated with the failure of TRAIL in treating colorectal cancer (CRC). To date, the exact mechanism by which TRAIL resistance may have occurred remains unknown. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed the critical role of the TRAIL decoy receptor family; consisting of decoy receptor 1 (DcR1; also known as TRAIL-R3), decoy receptor 2 (DcR2; also known as TRAIL-R4), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) in driving TRAIL resistance. This review highlights the expression of the decoy receptors in CRC and its possible association with the reduction in sensitivity towards TRAIL treatment based on the currently available in vitro, in vivo, and human studies. Additionally, discrepancies between the outcomes from different research groups are discussed, and essential areas are highlighted for future investigation of the roles of decoy receptors in modulating TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Overcoming TRAIL resistance through modulating the expression(s) and elucidating the role(s) of TRAIL decoy receptors hold great promise for TRAIL-based therapies to be extensively explored in treating human cancers including CRC.',\n",

A large number of studies have explored the relationship between PD-1, PD-L1, and different tumor susceptibility. However, these conclusions are not always consistent. Therefore, we updated this meta-analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE and other databases were searched systematically to obtain related research. Then, we used STATA15.0 software to carry out the final meta-analysis. The computational advantage is better than OR to evaluate this relationship. RESULTS A total of a total of 28 related studies were involved in our meta-analysis. It was found that PD-1 rs11568821 and rs7421861 increased the overall cancer probability in the allelic genetic model, while PD-1 rs36084323 effectively reduced the risk of cancer in the dominant genetic model. In the homozygous genetic model, PD-L1 rs17718883 effectively increased the probability of tumorigenesis. PD-L1rs4143815 is associated with a reduced incidence of cancer in heterozygote, homozygote and dominant genetic patterns. Subgroup analysis showed that PD-1rs2227981 can promote the susceptibility to breast cancer, while PD-1rs2227982 can reduce the susceptibility to breast cancer.

Despite recent advances made in the field of cancer biology and the therapies that have been developed [1, 2], it is clear that more advances are necessary for us to classify cancer as curable. The logical question that arises is simple: Why, despite all the technologies and medical innovations of our time, has a complete cure eluded us? This chapter sheds light on one of cancer's most impactful attributes: its heterogeneity and, more specifically, the intratumoral heterogeneity of cancer metabolism. Simply put, what makes cancer one of the deadliest diseases is its ability to change and adapt. Cancer cells' rapid evolution, coupled with their irrepressible ability to divide, gives most of them the advantage over our immune systems. In this chapter, we delve into the complexities of this adaptability and the vital role that metabolism plays in the rise and progression of this heterogeneity.\",\n",

The findings indicate that beta-carotene supplementation was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (RR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.06-1.26). This effect was even more noticeable among smokers and asbestos workers (RR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.08-1.35) and non-medics (RR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.07-1.29). A meta-regression found no relationship between the beta-carotene supplementation dose and the size of the negative effect associated with lung cancer risk. Our findings indicate that beta-carotene supplementation has no effect on lung cancer risk. Moreover, when used as the primary chemoprevention, beta-carotene may, in fact, increase the risk of lung cancer.',\n",
              " \"To obtain a better understanding on the role of microRNAs in the progression of cervical cancer, a systematic review was performed to analyze cervical cancer microRNA studies. We provide an overview of the studies investigating microRNA expression in relation to cervical cancer (CC) progression, highlighting their common outcomes and target gene interactions according to the regulatory pathways. To achieve this, we systematically searched through PubMed MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar for all articles between April 2010 and April 2020, in accordance with the PICO acronym (participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes). From 27 published reports, totaling 1721 cases and 1361 noncancerous control tissue samples, 26 differentially expressed microRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were identified in different International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages of cervical cancer development. It was identified that some of the dysregulated microRNAs were associated with specific stages of cervical cancer development. The results indicated that DEmiRNAs in different stages of cervical cancer were functionally involved in several key hallmarks of cancer, such as evading growth suppressors, enabling replicative immortality, activation of invasion and metastasis, resisting cell death, and sustained proliferative signaling. These dysregulated microRNAs could play an important role in cervical cancer's development. Some of the stage-specific microRNAs can also be used as biomarkers for cancer classification and monitoring the progression of cervical cancer.\",\n",
              " 'According to data from the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases and cancer are the two leading causes of mortality in the world [1]. Despite the immense effort to study these diseases and the constant innovation in treatment modalities, the number of deaths associated with cardiovascular diseases and cancer is predicted to increase in the coming decades [1]. From 2008 to 2030, due to population growth and population aging in many parts of the world, the number of deaths caused by cancer globally is projected to increase by 45%, corresponding to an annual increase of around four million people [1]. For cardiovascular diseases, this number is six million people [1]. In the United States, treatments for these two diseases are among the most costly and result in a disproportionate impact on low- and middleincome people. As the fight against these fatal diseases continues, it is crucial that we continue our investigation and broaden our understanding of cancer and cardiovascular diseases to innovate our prognostic and treatment approaches. Even though cardiovascular diseases and cancer are usually studied independently [2-12], there are some striking overlaps between their metabolic behaviors and therapeutic targets, suggesting the potential application of cardiovascular disease treatments for cancer therapy. More specifically, both cancer and many cardiovascular diseases have an upregulated glutaminolysis pathway, resulting in low glutamine and high glutamate circulating levels. Similar treatment modalities, such as glutaminase (GLS) inhibition and glutamine supplementation, have been identified to target glutamine metabolism in both cancer and some cardiovascular diseases. Studies have also found similarities in lipid metabolism, specifically fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and synthesis. Pharmacological inhibition of FAO and fatty acid synthesis have proven effective against many cancer types as well as specific cardiovascular conditions. Many of these treatments have been tested in clinical trials, and some have been medically prescribed to patients to treat certain diseases, such as angina pectoris [13, 14]. Other metabolic pathways, such as tryptophan catabolism and pyruvate metabolism, were also dysregulated in both diseases, making them promising treatment targets. Understanding the overlapping traits exhibited by both cancer metabolism and cardiovascular disease metabolism can give us a more holistic view of how important metabolic dysregulation is in the progression of diseases. Using established links between these illnesses, researchers can take advantage of the discoveries from one field and potentially apply them to the other. In this chapter, we highlight some promising therapeutic discoveries that can support our fight against cancer, based on common metabolic traits displayed in both cancer and cardiovascular diseases.',\n",

Thus, targeting the expression of known oncogenes in pancreatic cancer has been shown to lead to more effective treatment [3].

Gene expression varies tremendously, not only among different types of cancers but also within the same type of cancer among different patients. Cancer metabolism heterogeneity is often prompted and perpetuated not only by mutations in oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes but also by the innate diversity of the tumor microenvironment.

The literature (from 2015 to 2020) was reviewed to identify original research articles published in English. <b>Results:</b> A total of 13 studies were included in the review with some having multiple outcomes: five studies on pricing, four studies addressed affordability, five studies reported on availability, and four studies on access to anti-cancer medicines. The studies showed that in LMICs, there are wide variations in cancer prices and availability amongst the medicine brands and across different countries, with less affordability by patients with low-income levels, sometimes leading to treatment abandonment. <b>Conclusion:</b> Given the importance of medicine availability and prices in patient access and medicine buying capacity of governments, multi-pronged policy and program approaches by multiple stakeholders are needed to ensure access to cancer medicines.',\n",

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) may help understanding this observation, since they span decades of heart failure treatment. Methods and Results We assessed cancer, cardiovascular, and total mortality in phase 3 heart failure RCTs involving ≥90% individuals with left ventricular ejection fraction <45%, who were not acutely decompensated and did not represent specific patient subsets. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) of each type of death for the control and treatment arms were calculated using a random-effects model. Temporal trends and the impact of patient and RCT characteristics on mortality outcomes were evaluated by meta-regression analysis. Cancer mortality was reported for 15 (25%) of 61 RCTs, including 33\\xa0709 subjects, and accounted for 6% to 14% of all deaths and 17% to 67% of noncardiovascular deaths. Cancer mortality rate was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.46-0.71) per 100 patient-years without temporal trend (<i>P</i>=0.35). Cardiovascular (<i>P</i>=0.001) and total (<i>P</i>=0.001) mortality rates instead decreased over time. Moreover, cancer mortality was not influenced by treatment (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.92-1.28), unlike cardiovascular (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79-0.98) and all-cause (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84-0.99) mortality. Meta-regression did not reveal significant sources of heterogeneity. Possible reasons for excluding patients with malignancy overlapped among RCTs with and without published cancer mortality, and malignancy was an exclusion criterion only for 4 (8.7%) of the RCTs not reporting cancer mortality. Conclusions Cancer is a major, yet overlooked cause of noncardiovascular death in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, which has become more prominent with cardiovascular mortality decline.',\n",

Delay in diagnosis of this disease causes 60% of deaths. Thermal imaging is a low-risk modality for early breast cancer decision making without injecting any form of energy into the human body. Thermography as a screening tool was first introduced and well accepted in 1956. However, a study in 1977 found that it lagged behind other screening tools and is subjective. Soon after, its use was discontinued. This review discusses various screening tools used to detect breast cancer with a focus on thermography along with their advantages and shortcomings. With the maturation of thermography equipment and technological advances, this technique is emerging and has become the refocus of many biomedical researchers across the globe in the past decade. This study dispenses an exhaustive review of the work done related to interpretation of breast thermal variations and confers the discipline, frameworks, and methodologies used by different authors to diagnose breast cancer. Different performance metrics like accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity have also been examined. This paper outlines the most pressing research gaps for future work to improvise the accuracy of results for diagnosis of breast abnormalities using image processing tools, mathematical modelling and artificial intelligence.

However, only a few attentions have been paid to the molecular mechanism of abnormal glycosylation in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of breast cancer cells and the related intervention of drugs. This manuscript thus investigated the relationship between abnormal glycosylation, the EMT, and breast cancer metastasis. Then, the process of abnormal glycosylation, the classification and their molecular regulatory mechanisms of breast cancer were analyzed in detail. Last, potential drugs are introduced in different categories, which are expected to reverse or intervene the abnormal glycosylation of breast cancer. This review is conducive to an in-depth understanding of the metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancer cells, which will provide new ideas for the clinical regulation of glycosylation and related drug treatments in breast cancer.',\n",

In Romania, the cancers with the highest incidence are lung cancer for men and breast cancer for women. Cancer-related deaths follow the same pattern. More than 50% of the patients with lung cancers have distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. Metastases from lung cancer occur mainly in the brain, bones, liver, and adrenals. Anal metastases from primary lung cancer are extremely uncommon. As far as we know there are only 12 cases reported in the literature until now. Case report: Case report and systematic review. We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed using the following MeSH terms: \"lung cancer metastasis\" AND \"anal\" OR \"anus\" OR \"perianal\". The search was conducted from the beginning of the database onwards. No language exclusion criteria were used. We report the case of a patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma presenting with a painful, ulcerated and bleeding anal tumor. The anal tumor was excised with primary wound closure in spinal anesthesia. The pathology report and the immunohistochemistry of the specimen revealed metastasis of the lung adenocarcinoma. The review included 12 papers reporting 12 cases. The male/female ratio was 3/1. The average age was 62,16 years. Among these 12 patients, one had a SCLC. From the remaining 11 cases with NSCLC, 4 were adenocarcinomas, 4 squamous cell carcinomas, two anaplastic carcinomas and one mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The anal metastases were synchronous in 4 cases and metachronous in the rest of 8 cases. Since 2006 immuno-histochemistry plays an important role in the diagnosis of these metastases. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our patient presented an anal metastasis of a lung adenocarcinoma that was masquerading as a complicated hemorrhoidal disease. Because anal masses can be easily misdiagnosed, patients with lung cancers and anal or perianal complaints should be evaluated for metastatic disease. Medical teams that are managing such cases must be aware of this rare but possible situation. Immunohistochemistry plays an important role in establishing the diagnosis for the anal or perianal tumours in patients with lung cancer.',\n",

Monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy of ICIs targeting programmed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) has emerged as an alternative treatment for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, constrained by primary or acquired resistance, most patients obtain limited benefits from ICIs and occasionally suffer from severe immune-related adverse events. Moreover, owing to the complexity of the tumor microenvironment and the technical limitations, clinical application of PD-L1 and tumor mutation burden as biomarkers shows many deficiencies. Thus, additional predictive biomarkers are required to further advance the precision of proper patient selection, avoiding the exposure of potential non-responders to unnecessary immunotoxicity. Nowadays, an increasing number of investigations are focusing on peripheral blood as a noninvasive alternative to tissue biopsy in predicting and monitoring treatment outcomes.

Regular aspirin use was associated to a reduced risk of lung (RR = 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.79-0.98), breast (RR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.85-0.95), endometrial (RR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.84-0.98), ovarian (RR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.85-0.97) and prostate (RR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.89-0.96) cancer. However, for most neoplasms, nonsignificant risk reductions were reported in cohort and nested case-control studies and there was between-study heterogeneity. No association was reported for bladder and kidney cancer. No duration-risk relations were observed for most neoplasms, except for an inverse duration-risk relation for prostate cancer. The present meta-analysis confirms the absence of appreciable effect of regular aspirin use on cancers of the bladder and kidney and quantifies small and heterogeneous inverse associations for other cancers considered.',\n",
              " 'Identification of patients with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NICM) who are at risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) and could benefit from an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is challenging. The study aims to systematically assess the prognostic value of left ventricular (LV) midwall late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) pattern in patients with NICM and further explore its value on predicting SCD events. The study was prospectively registered in PROPSERO (CRD42019138468). We systematically searched PubMed, Ovid Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify studies that evaluated the association between LV midwall LGE and clinical outcomes (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and SCD or aborted SCD endpoint) in NICM patients. A meta-analysis was performed to determine pooled odds ratio (OR) for these adverse events. Seven studies including 1827 NICM patients over a mean follow-up duration of 36.1 ± 19.3 months were included. The presence of LV midwall LGE pattern was observed in 562 (30.8%) patients. The pooled OR was 3.37 [95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.35-8.42] for all-cause mortality, 5.56 (95% CI: 1.23-25.22) for cardiovascular mortality, and 2.25 (95% CI: 1.16-3.16) for SCD or aborted SCD. In a subgroup analysis with mean ejection fraction cut-off point of 35%, the pooled OR for SCD or aborted SCD was 2.06 (95% CI: 1.32-3.22) for LV ejection fraction (LVEF) > 35% and 2.49 (95% CI: 1.48-4.20) for LVEF ≤ 35%. In addition, our study indicated that LV midwall LGE showed an excellent negative predictive value in identifying high-risk NICM patients and that the number needed to treat with ICD implantation in NICM patients with midwall LGE is 7. The presence of LV midwall on LGE is a significant prognosticator of adverse events in NICM patients. Additionally, patients with LV midwall LGE may be considered for ICD therapy irrespective of LVEF.',\n",

Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were meta-analyzed using the generic inverse variance method. Nine studies were included. Compared with chemotherapy, the use of single agent ICIs in the second-line setting reduced the risk of death independent of PD-L1 expression (HR, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-0.96 and HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.85 for patients with PD-L1-negative and -positive tumors, respectively).

A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library databases, ASCO, and ESMO abstracts were conducted. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared safety profile of EGFR-TKIs with placebo were included. The end points included treatment-related adverse events (AEs), treatment discontinuation, and toxic death. Twenty-eight RCTs containing 17,800 patients were included. The analyses showed that the most frequently observed all-grade AEs in patients treated with EGFR-TKIs were diarrhea (53.7%), rash (48.6%), mucositis (46.5%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (38.9%), and skin reaction (35.2%). The most common high-grade (grade ≥3) AEs were mucositis (14.8%), pain (8.2%,), metabolism and nutrition disorders (7.4%), diarrhea (6.2%), dyspnea (6.1%), and hypertension (6.1%). The incidence of serious AEs, treatment discontinuation, and toxic death due to AEs were 18.2%, 12.36%, and 3.0%, respectively. Pooled risk ratio (RR) showed that the use of EGFR-TKIs was associated with an increased risk of developing AEs. Subgroup analysis indicated that the risk of AEs varied significantly according to tumor type, generation line, and drug type.

ICI-P is more often observed in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) than in those with other cancers. Likewise, it is more common in those receiving programmed cell death (PD)-1/PD-1 ligand inhibitors rather than cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 inhibitors alone. The frequency of ICI-P is higher when anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 are administered concomitantly. Despite the low fatality rate (≈13%), ICI-P is the leading cause of ICI-related deaths. This narrative review focuses on the epidemiology, clinical and radiological presentation and prognosis of ICI-P occurring in patients, especially those with advanced NSCLC.

Socioeconomic status (SES) has been shown to be associated with melanoma incidence. However, it is unclear if this association holds true in universal healthcare systems where screening, diagnostic, and treatment services are available to all patients. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence on the association of SES and melanoma incidence in Canada. A comprehensive search of PubMed and EMBASE yielded 7 studies reporting on melanoma incidence or outcomes with respect to SES in Canada. High SES was associated with increased melanoma incidence across all studies, which encompassed all Canadian provinces, and time periods spanning from 1979 to 2012. Studies also reported an increasing incidence of melanoma over time. There were substantial discrepancies in melanoma incidence across Canadian provinces, after controlling for SES and demographic characteristics. Populations of lower SES and living within certain healthcare regions had increased risks of advanced melanoma at diagnosis. This review highlights the potential for inequities in access to care even within a universal healthcare system.

              " 'The liver is an important contributor to the human immune system and it plays a pivotal role in the creation of both immunoreactive and tolerogenic conditions. Liver transplantation provides the best chance of survival for both children and adults with liver failure or cancer. With current demand exceeding the number of transplantable livers from donors following brain death, improved knowledge, technical advances and the desire to prevent avoidable deaths has led to the transplantation of organs from living, ABO incompatible (ABOi), cardiac death donors and machine based organ preservation with acceptable results. The liver graft is the most well-tolerated, from an immunological perspective, of all solid organ transplants. Evidence suggests successful cessation of immunosuppression is possible in ~20-40% of liver transplant recipients without immune mediated graft injury, a state known as \"operational tolerance.\" An immunosuppression free future following liver transplantation is an ambitious but perhaps not unachievable goal. The initial immune response following transplantation is a sterile inflammatory process mediated by the innate system and the mechanisms relate to the preservation-reperfusion process. The severity of this injury is influenced by graft factors and can have significant consequences. There are minimal experimental studies that delineate the differences in the adaptive immune response to the various forms of liver allograft. Apart from ABOi transplants, antibody mediated hyperacute rejection is rare following liver transplant. T-cell mediated rejection is common following liver transplantation and its incidence does not differ between living or deceased donor grafts. Transplantation in the first year of life results in a higher rate of operational tolerance, possibly due to a bias toward Th2 cytokines (IL4, IL10) during this period.

              " 'Chemotherapeutic drugs have a common intent to activate apoptosis in tumor cells. However, master regulators of apoptosis (e.g., p53, p16/CDKN2A) are frequently genetically inactivated in cancers, resulting in multidrug resistance. An alternative, p53-independent method for terminating malignant proliferation is to engage terminal-differentiation. Normally, the exponential proliferation of lineage-committed progenitors, coordinated by the master transcription factor (TF) MYC, is self-limited by forward-differentiation to terminal lineage-fates. In cancers, however, this exponential proliferation is disengaged from terminal-differentiation. The mechanisms underlying this decoupling are mostly unknown. We performed a systematic review of published literature (January 2007-June 2018) to identify gene pathways linked to differentiation-failure in three treatment-recalcitrant cancers: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ovarian cancer (OVC), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We analyzed key gene alterations in various apoptosis, proliferation and differentiation pathways to determine whether it is possible to predict treatment outcomes and suggest novel therapies. Poorly differentiated tumors were linked to poorer survival across histologies. Our analyses suggested loss-of-function events to master TF drivers of lineage-fates and their cofactors as being linked to differentiation-failure: genomic data in TCGA and ICGC databases demonstrated frequent haploinsufficiency of lineage master TFs (e.g., GATA4/6) in poorly differentiated tumors; the coactivators that these TFs use to activate genes (e.g. ARID1A, PBRM1) were also frequently inactivated by genetic mutation and/or deletion. By contrast, corepressor components (e.g., DNMT1, EED, UHRF1, and BAZ1A/B), that oppose coactivators to repress or turn off genes, were frequently amplified instead, and the level of amplification was highest in poorly differentiated lesions. This selection by neoplastic evolution towards unbalanced activity of transcriptional corepressors suggests these enzymes as candidate targets for inhibition aiming to re-engage forward-differentiation. This notion is supported by both pre-clinical and clinical trial literature.',\n",

Despite toxicities pharmacodynamics effects, the misunderstanding has always been around the corner: AEs themselves could lead to morbidity and mortality; on the other hand, the choice of the clinical outcomes to measure is not univocal. After the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 and anti-programmed death-1/programmed death ligand-1, new class-specific AEs have emerged, called immune-related AEs (irAEs). With irAEs, the correlation between toxicity and clinical outcomes has suddenly been suggested, but it is still to be proven. We conducted a systematic literature review regarding this emerging association, pointing out all the available data and speculating on the possible underlying mechanisms. Thirty-six studies were included in the analysis, involving different malignancies (mostly melanoma and lung cancer), with different measured clinical outcomes. The most of them were retrospective. Despite the high heterogeneity, and the enormous biases of the revised studies, we can assume that irAEs occurrence is linked to the therapeutic activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors, with a (certain) direct proportionality, maybe subtending the likelihood of an immunogenic phenotype. This phenomenon seems to occur with both anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 and anti-programmed death-1/programmed death ligand-1, and across different solid malignancies.',\n",

The role of the soluble form of the PD-L1 (sPD-L1) as a prognostic biomarker related to survival in solid cancer patients treated with immunotherapy has not yet been consistently evaluated. A systematic literature search of original articles in PubMed, MEDLINE and Scopus was conducted. Studies reporting hazard ratios (HRs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) or Kaplan−Meier curves or individual patient data for overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) associated with baseline levels of sPD-L1 in cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy treatment were considered eligible.

As for the distribution of patients by age, all but 3 of the selected studies considered young the patients younger than 65 years (n=10,832) and elderly those with 65 years and older (n=7723); 7 studies identified a third subgroup of very elderly patients aged 75 years and above (n=421). In elderly and very elderly patients ICIs significantly reduced the risk of death by 23% compared with SOC [hazard ratio (HR), 0.77; P<0.00001)]. On the contrary, a lack of a survival advantage of immunotherapy was observed in the subgroup of very elderly patients (HR, 0.85; P=0.39). When comparing the efficacy of ICIs between the 2 subpopulations (elderly vs. young), no significant difference in OS was observed (HR, 0.76; P=0.66). ICIs prolonged OS compared with SOC in both elderly and young patients affected by lung cancer, melanoma, and renal carcinoma, regardless of the age. In conclusion, ICIs (as monotherapy or combinations) significantly improved OS compared with SOC in both young and elderly patients with advanced cancers, regardless of the tumor type. The magnitude of this benefit is debated in patients aged 75 years and above.\",\n",

This systematic review of literature was designed to explore the current knowledge on ctDNA as a screening, diagnostic, prognostic, predictive and theranostic biomarker in the management of PA. We retrieved 62 full-text articles, 3 meta-analyses, 2 clinical trials, 1 abstract and 13 ongoing trials. Results were categorized into sections about screening, diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up of localized and advanced PA together with possible theranostics applications. Although its specificity is excellent, the current sensitivity of ctDNA remains a limitation especially in patients without metastatic disease. Therefore, this biomarker cannot be currently used as a screening or diagnostic tool. Increasing evidence suggests that ctDNA is a relevant candidate biomarker to assess minimal residual disease after radical surgery, but also a strong independent biomarker linked to a poor prognosis in advanced PA. Some recent data also indicates that ctDNA is an attractive biomarker for longitudinal follow-up and possibly early treatment adaptation. Its role in tumor profiling in advanced disease to decide targeted treatments remains to be explored. Altogether, ctDNA appears to be a reliable prognostic tool. Though promising results have been reported, further studies are still needed to define exactly how ctDNA can help physicians in the screening, diagnosis and treatment, as PA is expected to become a major cause of cancer-related deaths in the forthcoming decade.',\n",

A literature search on PubMed, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science and ProQuest databases was undertaken in January 2019. The primary outcomes of interest were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The relative frequency of lymphovascular invasion and its possible association with other clinicopathological parameters were addressed. A total of 22 studies and 2117 patients were included in this study. The frequency of lymphovascular invasion ranged from 5.2% to 72.5%. Lymphovascular invasion was associated with an increased likelihood of lymph node metastasis (OR\\u202f=\\u202f2.58; 95% CI 1.61-4.12; p\\u202f=\\u202f0.0001) and death (OR\\u202f=\\u202f3.09; 95% CI 1.82-5.26; p\\u202f=\\u202f0.0001), solid/higher-grade AdCC were more likely to present lymphovascular invasion (OR\\u202f=\\u202f5.51; 95% CI 1.87-16-21; p\\u202f=\\u202f0.002) and patients with this microscopic finding had a significantly lower OS (HR\\u202f=\\u202f8.30; 95% CI 1.68-40.91; p\\u202f=\\u202f0.009) and DFS (HR\\u202f=\\u202f3.76; 95% CI 1.13-12.53; p\\u202f=\\u202f0.03). In conclusion, lymphovascular invasion seems to be a significant predictor of poor prognosis for head and neck AdCC patients.\",\n",

Despite improvements in screening modalities, diagnostics, and treatment, disparities exist among Black men in this country. The primary objective of this systematic review is to describe the reported disparities in screening, diagnostics, and treatments as well as efforts to alleviate these disparities through community and educational outreach efforts. Critical review took place of retrospective, prospective, and socially descriptive data of English language publications in the PubMed database. Despite more advanced presentation, lower rates of screening and diagnostic procedures, and low rates of trial inclusion, subanalyses have shown that various modalities of therapy are quite effective in Black populations. Moreover, patients treated on prospective clinical trials and within equal-access care environments have shown similar outcomes regardless of race. Additional prospective studies and enhanced participation in screening, diagnostic and genetic testing, clinical trials, and community-based educational endeavors are important to ensure equitable progress in prostate cancer for all patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Notable progress has been made with therapeutic advances for prostate cancer, but racial disparities continue to exist. Differing rates in screening and utility in diagnostic procedures play a role in these disparities. Black patients often present with more advanced disease, higher prostate-specific antigen, and other adverse factors, but outcomes can be attenuated in trials or in equal-access care environments. Recent data have shown that multiple modalities of therapy are quite effective in Black populations. Novel and bold hypotheses to increase inclusion in clinical trial, enhance decentralized trial efforts, and enact successful models of patient navigation and community partnership are vital to ensure continued progress in prostate cancer disparities.',\n",

Its definition and staging have been revised in the eight edition of the AJCC/TNM classification, which took effect in 2018. Novel molecular classifications for GC have been recently established and the process of translating these classifications into clinical practice is ongoing. The cornerstone of GC treatment is surgical, in a context of multimodal therapy. Surgical treatment is being standardized, and is evolving according to new anatomical concepts and to the recent technological developments. This is leading to a massive improvement in the use of mini-invasive techniques. Mini-invasive techniques aim to be equivalent to open surgery from an oncologic point of view, with better short-term outcomes. The persecution of better short-term outcomes also includes the optimization of the perioperative management, which is being implemented on large scale according to the enhanced recovery after surgery principles. In the era of precision medicine, multimodal treatment is also evolving.

We examined 27 LELCC cases through next-generation sequencing using a panel of genes commonly mutated in primary liver cancers. Alterations in BAP1, ARID1A, ARID2, and PBRM1 were detected through immunohistochemistry. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed to analyze FGFR2 fusions and CCND1 amplification. LELCC is histologically classified as predominantly undifferentiated or glandular. Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNA (EBER) expression was found in 16 LELCCs. Approximately 50% of LELCCs expressed programmed death-ligand 1 strongly. Notably, recurrent pTERT and TP53 mutations were detected in 9 (38%) and 8 (33%) tumors, respectively. Only 2 LELCCs exhibited loss of expression for PBRM1. Alterations in genes typically involved in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, including IDH1, IDH2, ARID1A, ARID2, and BAP1, and FGFR2 fusions, were not identified. The 2-step clustering analysis showed 2 distinct subgroups in LELCC, which were separated by EBER expression. A meta-analysis of all reported cases (n=85) has shown that EBER+ LELCC is strongly associated with the female sex, younger age, and exhibited predominantly glandular differentiation (P=0.001, 0.012, and <0.001, respectively). Patients with EBER- LELCC were more likely to have viral hepatitis and cirrhosis (P=0.003 and 0.005, respectively). Genetic analysis demonstrated that EBER- LELCC was significantly associated with pTERT and TP53 mutations (P=0.033 and 0.008, respectively). In conclusion, LELCC is genetically distinct from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. EBER- LELCC may exhibit a different pathogenesis from EBER+ LELCC. High programmed death-ligand 1 expression in LELCC has implications for potential immunotherapeutic strategies.',\n",

Despite the extensive efforts for establishing accurate diagnostic assays and efficient therapeutic schemes, disease prevalence is on the rise, in part, however, also due to improved early detection. For years, studies were focused on genomics and transcriptomics, aiming at the discovery of new tests with diagnostic or prognostic potential. However, cancer phenotypic characteristics seem most likely to be a direct reflection of changes in protein metabolism and function, which are also the targets of most drugs. Investigations at the protein level are therefore advantageous particularly in the case of in-depth characterization of tumor progression and invasiveness. Innovative high-throughput proteomic technologies are available to accurately evaluate cancer formation and progression and to investigate the functional role of key proteins in cancer. Employing these new highly sensitive proteomic technologies, cancer biomarkers may be detectable that contribute to diagnosis and guide curative treatment when still possible. In this review, the recent advances in proteomic biomarker research in cancer are outlined, with special emphasis placed on the identification of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for solid tumors. In view of the increasing number of screening programs and clinical trials investigating new treatment options, we discuss the molecular connections of the biomarkers as well as their potential as clinically useful tools for diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy monitoring of solid tumors.',\n",

RESULTS: There were four studies included in the analysis, enrolling overall 2982 patients, of which 1494 in ALND arm and 1488 in the SLN\\u2009±\\u2009ALND arm. No statistically significant difference was observed in locoregional recurrence, breast cancer-related death and overall death. Locoregional recurrence was observed in 2.8% (ALND) vs. 4.1% (SLND\\u2009±\\u2009ALND), (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.20-2.30).

During recent years, low-molecular weight heparins (LMWH) have been a \"gold standard\" for the treatment of cancer-associated venous thrombosis (CAVT). In the recent decade, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have become extensively used for the treatment and prevention of VTEC relapse in non-oncological patients and also for primary prevention of VTEC following orthopedic surgery. Taking into account the oral route of administration, the predictable and convenient pharmacokinetic profile, and the absence of need for coagulation monitoring, it seems possible to use DOACs for the treatment and secondary prevention of VTEС in oncological patients. A meta-analysis of 4 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) showed a higher efficacy of DOACs compared to LMWHs, however, with a greater risk of bleedings in CAVT.

We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for publications between database inception and February 2022 and we collected the patient characteristics, disease presentation, employed treatment strategies, and disease outcomes. In addition to our patient, we identified 96 cases of ECS due to MTC reported in literature. Mean age at diagnosis was 44.4 years (range 10-84), and there was a male predominance (male:female [M:F]\\u2009=\\u20091.8:1). Most patients (51%) presented with metastatic disease at diagnosis and showed severe hypercortisolism. Seventeen patients developed distant metastasis and hypercortisolism during follow-up.

We implemented the appraisal of the eligible studies according to the choice criterion. We used Hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) to evaluate the prognostic role of PD-L1 for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Odds ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95% CI were calculated to evaluate the connection between PD-L1 and clinicopathological features. Publication bias was tested. <b>Results:</b> 13 studies, which published range from 2009 to 2017 were contained in this meta-analysis, involving 1,843 patients with HCC.

Relevant studies were identified according to predefined selection criteria. Five relevant publications on 4 completed trials were identified. In most studies, >90% of patients were able to undergo surgery within the planned timeframe after neoadjuvant immunotherapy. There was a high incidence of open thoracotomy procedures, either planned or converted from a planned minimally invasive approach. Mortality ranged from 0 to 5%, but none of the reported deaths were considered directly treatment-related. Morbidities were reported according to adverse events related to neoadjuvant systemic therapy, and postoperative surgical complications. Survival outcomes were limited due to short follow-up periods. Major pathologic response ranged from 40.5 to 56.7%, whilst complete pathologic response of the primary tumor ranged from 15 to 33%. Radiological responses were reported according to RECIST criteria and fluorodeoxyglucose-avidity.

The increasing availability of genomic information and large-scale meta-analytic data sets for clinicians has motivated the extension of traditional survival prediction based on the Cox proportional hazards model. The aim of our paper is to develop a personalized risk prediction formula for death according to genetic factors and dynamic tumour progression status based on meta-analytic data. To this end, we extend the existing joint frailty-copula model to a model allowing for high-dimensional genetic factors. In addition, we propose a dynamic prediction formula to predict death given tumour progression events possibly occurring after treatment or surgery. For clinical use, we implement the computation software of the prediction formula in the joint.Cox R package. We also develop a tool to validate the performance of the prediction formula by assessing the prediction error.

Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death among Hispanic women, and Hispanic women receive mammography screening at lower rates than some other ethnic groups. This low rate of screening mammography is associated with increased risk for possible late-stage diagnosis and lower survival rates. Educational interventions could play a role in increasing screening mammography rates among Hispanic women. This systematic review synthesized the current literature on educational interventions to increase mammography screening among Hispanic women. The review included studies published between May 2003 and September 2017 with experimental and quasi-experimental interventions to increase mammography screening among Hispanics in the U.S. Five studies out of an initial 269 studies met inclusion criteria for the review. All studies employed an interpersonal intervention strategy with community health workers, or promotoras, to deliver the mammography screening intervention. For each study, odds ratios (OR) were calculated to estimate intervention effectiveness based on similar follow-up time periods. The study ORs resulted in a narrow range between 1.02 and 2.18, indicating a low to moderate intervention effect for these types of interpersonal cancer education interventions. The summary OR for the random effects model was 1.67 (CI 1.24-2.26). Hispanics exhibit lower levels of adherence to screening mammography than non-Hispanic whites. Interpersonal cancer education interventions such as the use of promotoras may help to mediate the impact of barriers to receiving a mammogram such as low health literacy, deficits in knowledge about the benefits of screening, and low awareness of the availability of screening services.',\n",

Currently, all of the commercially available immunohistochemistry assays have been validated for use with histology specimens although, in routine clinical practice, approximately 30-40 % of patients with advanced NSCLC have only cytology specimens available for diagnosis, staging, and biomarker analysis. This systematic review evaluated the success rate, concordance, and clinical utility of using cytology specimens to assess tumor PD-L1 expression levels compared with histology specimens from patients with advanced NSCLC. EMBASE and PubMed database searches identified 142 unique, relevant publications, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria for at least one analysis. In 709 specimens, across seven publications, the proportion of cytology specimens evaluable for PD-L1 testing was 92.0 %. Among nine studies eligible for concordance analysis between cytology and histology specimens at a PD-L1 tumor cell expression cutoff of ≥50 %, overall percentage agreement was 89.7 % (n = 428), 72.0 % for positive percentage agreement (n = 218), and 95.0 % for negative percentage agreement (n = 258); results using a tumor PD-L1 expression cutoff of ≥1 % were similar. Our analyses suggest that using cytology specimens to assess PD-L1 expression is feasible, with good levels of concordance between cytology and histology specimens using PD-L1 tumor cell expression cutoffs of ≥1 % and ≥50 %. In conclusion, there is no convincing evidence that cytology specimens are inadequate or inferior to histology specimens for assessing PD-L1 expression in patients with NSCLC.',\n",

              " 'With rapid advances in our understanding of cancer, there is an expanding number of potential novel combination therapies, including novel-novel combinations. Identifying which combinations are appropriate and in which subpopulations are among the most difficult questions in medical research. We conducted a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-guided systematic review of trials of novel-novel combination therapies involving immunotherapies or molecular targeted therapies in advanced solid tumors. A MEDLINE search was conducted using a modified Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for published clinical trials between July 1, 2017, and June 30, 2020, in the top-ranked medical and oncology journals. Trials were evaluated according to a criterion adapted from previously published Food and Drug Administration guidance and other key considerations in designing trials of combinations. This included the presence of a strong biological rationale, the use of a new established or emerging predictive biomarker prospectively incorporated into the clinical trial design, appropriate comparator arms of monotherapy or supportive external data sources and a primary endpoint demonstrating a clinically meaningful benefit. Of 32 identified trials, there were 11 (34%) trials of the novel-novel combination of anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) therapy, and 10 (31%) trials of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) combination therapy. 20 (62.5%) trials were phase II trials, while 12 (37.5%) were phase III trials. Most (72%) trials lacked significant preclinical evidence supporting the development of the combination in the given indication. A majority of trials (69%) were conducted in biomarker unselected populations or used pre-existing biomarkers within the given indication for patient selection. Most studies (66%) were considered to have appropriate comparator arms or had supportive external data sources such as prior studies of monotherapy. All studies were evaluated as selecting a clinically meaningful primary endpoint. In conclusion, designing trials to evaluate novel-novel combination therapies presents numerous challenges to demonstrate efficacy in a comprehensive manner. A greater understanding of biological rationale for combinations and incorporating predictive biomarkers may improve effective evaluation of combination therapies. Innovative statistical methods and increasing use of external data to support combination approaches are potential strategies that may improve the efficiency of trial design.

This study aimed to establish afatinib-resistant cell lines from which afatinib resistance-associated genes are identified and the underlying mechanisms of multiple-TKI resistance in NSCLC can be further investigated. Nude mice bearing subcutaneous NSCLC HCC827 tumors were administered with afatinib at different dose intensities (5-100 mg/kg).

Four pooled and clinical cohort analyses were used to correlate driver oncogene mutation status and tumor microenvironment based on PD-L1 and CD8<sup>+</sup> tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Immune infiltrating patterns were also established for genomic NSCLC subgroups using the CIBERSORT algorithm. <b>Results:</b> Based on East Asian NSCLC patients, TIDE analyses revealed that for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged tumors yielded inferior responses; however, although Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)-mutant tumors responded better, the difference was not statistically significant (EGFR: <i>P</i> = 0.037; ALK: <i>P</i> < 0.001; KRAS: <i>P</i> = 0.701). Pooled and clinical cohort analyses demonstrated tumor immune microenvironment heterogeneities correlated with oncogenic patterns. The results showed remarkably higher PD-L1- and TIL-positive KRAS-mutant tumors, suggesting KRAS mutations may drive an inflammatory phenotype with adaptive immune resistance. However, the EGFR-mutant or ALK-rearranged groups showed a remarkably higher proportion of PD-L1-/TIL-tumors, suggesting an uninflamed phenotype with immunological ignorance. Notably, similar to triple wild-type NSCLC tumors, EGFR L858R-mutant tumors positively correlated with an inflammatory phenotype, suggesting responsiveness to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Furthermore, the CIBERSORT algorithm results revealed that EGFR-mutant and ALK-rearranged tumors were characterized by an enriched resting memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population (<i>P</i> < 0.001), as well as a lack of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<i>P</i> < 0.01), and activated memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<i>P</i> = 0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> Our study highlighted the complex relationships between immune heterogeneity and immunotherapeutic responses in East Asian NSCLC patients regarding oncogenic dependence.',\n",

However, there are still challenges to be overcome regarding the off-target toxicity of many of these treatments. Oncological therapies can lead to future infertility in women. Given this negative impact on long-term quality of life, fertility preservation is highly recommended. While gamete and ovarian tissue cryopreservation are the usual methods offered, new pharmacological-based options aiming to reduce ovarian damage during oncological treatment are very attractive. In this vein, advances in the field of transcriptomics and epigenomics have brought small noncoding RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNAs), into the spotlight in oncology. MicroRNAs also play a key role in follicle development as regulators of follicular growth, atresia and steroidogenesis. They are also involved in DNA damage repair responses and they can themselves be modulated during chemotherapy. For these reasons, miRNAs may be an interesting target to develop new protective therapies during oncological treatment. This review summarizes the physiological role of miRNAs in reproduction. Considering recently developed strategies based on miRNA therapy in oncology, we highlight their potential interest as a target in fertility preservation and propose future strategies to make the transition from bench to clinic.', attributes={'Label': 'BACKGROUND'}),\n",

A framework of known clinical presentations, diagnostic features, disease complications, treatments, and outcomes to improve prognostication was constructed by a systematic review in 2011. However, some aspects must be discussed further in light of recent advances in lymphoma research. We collected cardiac lymphoma case reports published from January 2009 to January 2019, collected statistics from each patient, and performed a systematic analysis. The epidemiological characteristics, clinical manifestations, treatments, responses, and survival of primary cardiac lymphoma (PCL) patients are described. We obtained 158 cases of heart lymphoma, of which 101 were defined as PCL. There were more male than female cases. Most cases were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Six cases of PCL in cardiac myxomas were described. Patients with arrhythmia had shorter progression-free survival compared those without (HR 0.334, 95% CI 0.112-0.999, log-rank P\\u2009=\\u20090.042).

              " 'Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of gynaecological cancer deaths and the seventh most commonly diagnosed cancer among women worldwide, so that, as it is related to substantial and increasing disease burden, the management of ovarian cancer survivors should be a priority. Such issues involve prevention and management of emotional distress, anxiety/depressive symptoms, and maintenance of quality of life from initial diagnosis to post-treatment. Within this framework, sleep disturbances, in particular insomnia, are emerging as modifiable determinants of mental health, also contributing to substantial morbidity among cancer, including ovarian cancer. To this aim we conducted a systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines on prevalence and management of insomnia and circadian sleep disorders in ovarian cancer, while selecting 22 papers. Insomnia was evaluated in ovarian cancer and, while circadian sleep disturbances were poorly assessed in ovarian cancer, insomnia increased from 14% to 60% of patients. Insomnia was associated with cancer-related comorbid conditions such as emotional distress, anxiety/depressive symptoms and low quality of life. Despite this evidence, no studies have been conducted about insomnia treatment in ovarian cancer. The burden of insomnia and circadian sleep disorders in patients with ovarian cancer still needs to be addressed, and requires a call to action for the evaluation and management of these potential modifiable factors that might contribute to ovarian cancer morbidity.',\n",
              " 'Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) are multifunctional enzymes that oxidize diverse endogenous and exogenous aldehydes. We conducted a meta-analysis based on The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus data and detected genetic alterations in ALDH1A1, ALDH1A3, or ALDH3A1, 86% of which were gene amplification or mRNA upregulation, in 31% of nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). The expression of these isoenzymes impacted chemoresistance and shortened survival times in patients. We hypothesized that these enzymes provide an oxidative advantage for the persistence of NSCLC. To test this hypothesis, we used genetic and pharmacological approaches with DIMATE, an irreversible inhibitor of ALDH1/3. DIMATE showed cytotoxicity in 73% of NSCLC cell lines tested and demonstrated antitumor activity in orthotopic xenografts via hydroxynonenal-protein adduct accumulation, GSTO1-mediated depletion of glutathione and increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Consistent with this result, ALDH1/3 disruption synergized with ROS-inducing agents or glutathione synthesis inhibitors to trigger cell death. In lung cancer xenografts with high to moderate cisplatin resistance, combination treatment with DIMATE promoted strong synergistic responses with tumor regression. These results indicate that NSCLCs with increased expression of ALDH1A1, ALDH1A3, or ALDH3A1 may be targeted by strategies involving inhibitors of these isoenzymes as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy to overcome patient-specific drug resistance.',\n",

              " 'Nearly half of advanced melanoma patients do not achieve a clinical response with anti-programmed cell death 1 protein (PD1) therapy (i.e. primary resistance) or initially achieve a clinical response but eventually progress during or following further treatment (i.e. secondary resistance). A consensus definition for tumor resistance to anti-PD1 monotherapy was published by Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Immunotherapy Resistance Taskforce (SITC) in 2020. A systematic literature review (SLR) of clinical trials and observational studies was conducted to characterize the proportions of advanced melanoma patients who have progressed on anti-PD1 therapies. The SLR included 55 unique studies and the SITC definition of primary resistance was applied to 37 studies that specified disease progression by best overall response. Median and range of patients with primary resistance in studies that specified first-line and second-line or higher anti-PD1 monotherapy was 35.50% (21.19-39.13%; n = 4 studies) and 41.54% (30.00-56.41%, n = 3 studies); median and range of patients with primary resistance in studies that specified first-line and second-line or higher combination therapy was 30.23% (15.79-33.33%; n = 6 studies), and 70.00% (61.10-73.33%; n = 3 studies). Primary resistance to anti-PD1 monotherapies and when in combination with ipilimumab are higher in patients receiving second-line or higher therapies, in patients with acral, mucosal, and uveal melanoma, and in patients with active brain metastases. The percentage of patients with primary resistance was generally consistent across clinical trials, with variability in resistance noted for observational studies. Limitations include applying the SITC definitions to combination therapies, where consensus definitions are not yet available. Future studies should highly consider utilizing the SITC definitions to harmonize how resistance is classified and facilitate meaningful context for clinical activity.',\n",
