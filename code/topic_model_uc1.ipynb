We comprehensively quantified the association between depression and anxiety defined by symptom scales or clinical diagnosis and the risk of cancer incidence, cancer-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality in cancer patients. Pooled estimates of the relative risks (RRs) for cancer incidence and mortality were performed in a meta-analysis by random effects or fixed effects models as appropriate. Associations were tested in subgroups stratified by different study and participant characteristics. Fifty-one eligible cohort studies involving 2,611,907 participants with a mean follow-up period of 10.3 years were identified. Overall, depression and anxiety were associated with a significantly increased risk of cancer incidence (adjusted RR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.06-1.19), cancer-specific mortality (1.21, 1.16-1.26), and all-cause mortality in cancer patients (1.24, 1.13-1.35). The estimated absolute risk increases (ARIs) associated with depression and anxiety were 34.3 events/100,000 person years (15.8-50.2) for cancer incidence and 28.2 events/100,000 person years (21.5-34.9) for cancer-specific mortality. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that clinically diagnosed depression and anxiety were related to higher cancer incidence, poorer cancer survival, and higher cancer-specific mortality. Psychological distress (symptoms of depression and anxiety) was related to higher cancer-specific mortality and poorer cancer survival but not to increased cancer incidence. Site-specific analyses indicated that overall, depression and anxiety were associated with an increased incidence risks for cancers of the lung, oral cavity, prostate and skin, a higher cancer-specific mortality risk for cancers of the lung, bladder, breast, colorectum, hematopoietic system, kidney and prostate, and an increased all-cause mortality risk in lung cancer patients. These analyses suggest that depression and anxiety may have an etiologic role and prognostic impact on cancer, although there is potential reverse causality; Furthermore, there was substantial heterogeneity among the included studies, and the results should be interpreted with caution. Early detection and effective intervention of depression and anxiety in cancer patients and the general population have public health and clinical importance.',\n",
              " \"<b>Background and Importance.</b>-Globally, almost one million new cases of stomach cancer were estimated to have occurred in 2012 (952,000 cases, 6.8% of the total), making it the fifth most common malignancy in the world, after lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate. Gastric cancer was the world's third leading cause of cancer mortality in 2012, responsible for 723,000 deaths, 8.8% of total cancer deaths. <sup>1</sup> In 2017, 28,000 new cases and 10,960 deaths are estimated for gastric cancer in the United States. <sup>2</sup> Estimated United States prevalence counts on January 1, 2014, for patients diagnosed within the previous 5-years was 48,271 (SEER Cancer Statistics Review-2014). Prognostic indices of survival & mortality in patients with gastric cancer are related to tumor stage including nodal involvement, direct tumor extension beyond the gastric wall, and wide-spread dissemination. Tumor histologic grade (degree of loss of cellular differentiation), and oncotype-specific ICD-O-3 phenotypes also provides important prognostic information. By more than 90%, the most common histologic type of stomach cancer is adenocarcinoma. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) ICD-O-3 SEER Site/Histology Validation List catalog (September 18, 2015) enumerates almost 200 subtypes for gastric cancer sites C160-C166, C168-C169. Based on the results of molecular evaluation of 295 primary gastric adenocarcinomas reported to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project in 2014, a novel classification separating gastric cancers into four subtypes according to Epstein-Barr virus positive status, microsatellite instability, chromosomal instability, or genomic stability was proposed. <sup>3</sup> Of interest, <i>Helicobacter Pylori</i> infection and its role in the development of gastric cancer is not mentioned. All cancer has a genetic basis. However, given the histologic and etiologic heterogeneity of gastric cancer, eventual comprehensive molecular characterization and genomic sequencing with identification of chromosomal aberrations, nucleotide substitutions mortality follow-up study is focused on short- and long-term comparative patient outcomes of stomach adenocarcinoma, ICD-O-3 8140-8147, and other selected gastric cancer oncotypes. <b>Objective.</b>-To update trends in incidence, prevalence, short- and long-term survival, and mortality of gastric cancer using the statistical database of SEER*Stat 8.3.4 for diagnosis years 1973-2014 employing multiple case selection variables. <b>Methods.</b>-A retrospective, population-based study using nationally representative data from the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program to evaluate 157,258 cases for diagnosis years 1973-2014 comparing multiple variables of age, sex, race, stage, grade, cohort entry time-period, disease duration and histologic oncotype: Relative survival statistics were analyzed in two cohorts: 1973-1994 and 1995-2014. Survival statistics were derived from: SEER*Stat Database: Incidence\\xa0- SEER 9 Regs Research Data, November 2016 Submission (1973-2014) <Katrina/Rita Population Adjustment> Released April 2017. <b>Results.</b>-By more than 90%, the most common type of stomach cancer is adenocarcinoma. From 1975 to 2014, gastric cancer incidence has been steadily decreasing in the United States at the rate of -1.5% per year. In a total of 157,258 cases of invasive staged cancer of the stomach, mean age in males was 67.5 years, females 69.6\\xa0years, both male & female 67.4 years. Greater than 90% of cases occurred between ages 45-85+ years with the zenith in males at 70-74 years (15.1%) and 85+ years in females (17.9%). The overall annual US death rate per 100,000 per year for stomach cancer from 1975 to 2014 has decreased from 5.1 to 3.1, but excess mortality at 0-5 years remains exceedingly high. Mortality is a function of incidence and survival, and unfortunately, almost all of this decrease is due to the decrease in incidence of stomach cancer. Of the 157,258 invasive cases, 86.6% were clinically staged and 76.8% were histologically graded. <b>Conclusions.</b>-Given the histologic and etiologic heterogeneity of gastric cancer, major improvements in mortality and survival outcomes await the development of diagnostic markers for earlier diagnosis, and genomic sequencing and identification of chromosomal aberrations, nucleotide substitutions and epigenetic modifications that drive malignant transformation, for the development of targeted therapies for almost 200 gastric cancer subtypes.\",\n",

Studies examining the influence of HPV status on survival after vulvar cancer have been conflicting and limited by small study populations. Therefore, the aim of this review and meta-analysis was to examine whether HPV status influences survival after vulvar cancer, which, to our knowledge, has not been done before. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Cochrane Library and Embase to identify studies examining survival after histologically verified and HPV tested vulvar cancer.

We aimed to synthesize the current evidence regarding the impact of plant-based dietary patterns (PBDPs) on cancer-related outcomes in the general population and in cancer survivors. Considered outcomes included overall cancer mortality, cancer-specific mortality, and cancer recurrence. A rapid review was conducted, whereby 2234 original articles related to the topic were identified via Pubmed/Medline. We selected 26 articles, which were classified into studies on PBDPs and cancer outcomes at pre-diagnosis: vegan/vegetarian diet (<i>N</i> = 5), provegetarian diet (<i>N</i> = 2), Mediterranean diet (<i>N</i> = 13), and studies considering the same at post-diagnosis (<i>N</i> = 6). Pooled estimates of the associations between the aforementioned PBDPs and the different cancer outcomes were obtained by applying random effects meta-analysis. The few studies available on the vegetarian diet failed to support its prevention potential against overall cancer mortality when compared with a non-vegetarian diet (e.g., pooled hazard ratio (HR) = 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.88-1.06). The insufficient number of studies evaluating provegetarian index scores in relation to cancer mortality did not permit a comprehensive assessment of this association. The association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cancer mortality reached statistical significance (e.g., pooled HR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.79-0.89). However, no study considered the influence of prognostic factors on the associations. In contrast, post-diagnostic studies accounted for prognostic factors when assessing the chemoprevention potential of PBDPs, but also were inconclusive due to the limited number of studies on well-defined plant-based diets. Thus, whether plant-based diets before or after a cancer diagnosis prevent negative cancer-related outcomes needs to be researched further, in order to define dietary guidelines for cancer survivors.',\n",

We have therefore carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies reporting on the associations between vegetable and fruit intake with cancer recurrence and mortality and all-cause mortality in cancer patients. After a comprehensive search of PubMed and Scopus databases, the results of 28 selected articles were analyzed. A high vegetable intake before diagnosis was inversely associated with overall mortality in survivors of head and neck (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.87) and ovarian cancer (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.91).

Therefore, more studies are needed to clarify the association between vegetable and fruit consumption and the prognosis of these different types of cancer. To date, the general recommendation to consume ≥5 servings of vegetables and fruit per day (∼400 g/d) could underestimate the needs of cancer survivors, particularly those with ovarian tumors, in which the recommendation could increase to ∼600 g/d (i.e., 300 g/d of vegetables and 300 g/d of fruit).',\n",

The most consistent evidence, observed across several studies, was for colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer. Of the included studies, 18 did not account for socio-economic position. Lower survival for more disadvantaged patients is well documented; therefore, it could be beneficial for future research to take socio-economic factors into consideration when assessing rural/urban differences in cancer survival. Some studies cited differential stage at diagnosis and treatment modalities as major contributing factors to regional inequalities in cancer survival. Further research is needed to disentangle the mediating effects of these factors, which may help to establish effective interventions to improve survival for patients living outside major cities.',\n",

Out of 3451 studies screened, 47 studies including 21,194 patients passed the screening criteria. The average prevalence of myosteatosis was 46.4%. Patients with myosteatosis had 44% increased mortality risk compared with non-myosteatosis patients (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.33-1.55, P < .05). The predictive value of myosteatosis held regardless of country zone, study design, statistical model, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) scores, treatment, sample size, and tumor stage. Nevertheless, the predictive value of myosteatosis was only evident for patients with esophagogastric cancers, cholangiocarcinoma/pancreatic cancers, or colorectal cancers. Overall, the results of this meta-analysis were robust based on sensitivity, subgroup, meta-regression, and trial sequential analyses and suggested that myosteatosis predicted worse overall survival (OS) in digestive malignancies patients.',\n",

Third, a meta-analysis of published trials was performed to explore the impact of LM on the efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 based therapy in advanced lung cancers. Pan-cancer analysis revealed that patients with LM had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) than those without LM (10 <i>vs.</i> 20 months; <i>P <</i> 0.0001). Subgroup analysis showed that the presence of LM was associated with markedly shorter OS than those without LM in ICI monotherapy group (<i>P <</i> 0.0001), but it did not reach the statistical significance in ICI-based combination therapy (<i>P</i> = 0.0815). In NSCLC, the presence of LM was associated with significantly inferior treatment outcomes in both pan-cancer and real-world cohort. Interestingly, ICI-based monotherapy and combination therapy could simultaneously prolong progression-free survival (PFS) and OS than chemotherapy in patients without LM. However, ICI-based monotherapy could not prolong PFS than chemotherapy in patients with LM while ICI-based combination therapy could dramatically prolong both PFS and OS. Together, these findings suggested that the presence of LM was the negative predictive factor in cancer patients received ICIs monotherapy, especially in NSCLC. ICI-based combination therapy might overcome the intrinsic resistance of LM to ICIs while the optimal combinatorial strategies remain under further investigation.',\n",

The aim of this article was to evaluate and summarise the evidence on the socioeconomic conditions of childhood cancer survivors and to identify survivors at particular risk of adverse socioeconomic outcomes. An extensive literature search of three electronic databases was conducted. Of 419 articles identified, 52 met the inclusion criteria. All the selected articles were appraised for quality, and findings were summarised in a narrative synthesis. Childhood cancer survivors were at higher risk of adverse socioeconomic outcomes with regard to educational achievement, income and social security benefits than the general population or a sibling comparison group. The risks for unemployment and a lower occupational position were significantly increased only for survivors of a central nervous system tumour. Notably, survivors of central nervous system tumours, survivors treated with cranial radiotherapy and those diagnosed at younger age independent of cancer type were determinants of particular adverse socioeconomic outcomes. Given the increasing population of childhood cancer survivors, targeted follow-up interventions and support strategies addressing not only the somatic and psychiatric late effects but also the socioeconomic difficulties that some childhood cancer survivors face is of high importance to reduce social inequity, and ensure a high quality of life after childhood cancer.',\n",

However, its association with breast cancer has not been systematically evaluated. In the current study, a meta-analysis was conducted to clarify the association between MALAT-1 and the prognosis and clinicopathological features of breast cancer. Relevant literature published in several databases was searched. Hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to evaluate the effect of MALAT-1 expression on the survival outcomes and clinicopathological features of breast cancer. A total of 12 studies involving 4106 patients were identified. Pooled HR demonstrated that elevated MALAT-1 expression significantly predicted unfavorable overall survival (HR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.66-2.56, P<0.0001) in patients with breast cancer. Subgroup analysis stratified by cancer type, sample size, and method of variance analysis also showed statistically significant associations.

Surgical resection is an alternative treatment of hepatic metastases. Whether patients can obtain benefit from thermal ablation of hepatic metastases is still controversial.A systematic literature search was undertaken (1990-2018). Publications were included if they studied more than 7 patients undergoing thermal ablation for hepatic metastasis from gastric cancer in the absence of peritoneal disease or other distant organ involvement. The primary outcome was the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival. Comparison between thermal ablation and systematic chemotherapy or hepatic resection had been carried out. The influence of liver metastasis-related factors, such as <3\\u200acm versus >3\\u200acm, single versus multiple and metachronous versus synchronous upon survival was also assessed.The median survival of thermal ablation for the 12 studies included was 22.93[20.45-25.41] months. Procedures were associated with a median 30-day morbidity of 6% (0%-23%) and with no mortality. The median 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival were 79.14%, 39.79%, 28.45%, and 19.46%, respectively. Thermal ablation of hepatic metastasis was associated with improved overall survival compared with systematic chemotherapy (HR\\u200a=\\u200a2.12; 95% CI 0.77-3.47; P=.000).

Many reports of donor-derived cancers in liver transplant recipients have been published, but they have not been systematically summarized into a lucid and unified analysis. The present study is an attempt to provide clarity to this unusual but clinically important problem. We systematically reviewed all patient reports, patient series, and registries published on cancer transmission events through the end of December 2019. We identified a total of 67 publications with 92 transmission events. The most frequently transmitted cancers were lymphomas (30; 32.6%), melanomas (8; 8.7%), and neuroendocrine tumors (8; 8.7%). Most of the melanomas were metastasizing, whereas most of the lymphomas were localized to the graft. The median time to cancer diagnosis after transplantation was 7\\xa0months, with 78.1% of diagnoses established in the first year. Melanoma carried the worst prognosis, with no recipients alive at 1\\xa0year after cancer diagnosis. Lymphoma recipients had a better outcome, with more than 75% surviving at 2\\xa0years. A metastatic cancer carries a worse prognosis for recipients, and recipients with localized cancer can benefit from the chance to undergo transplantation again. The findings confirm the need to pay attention to donors with a history of melanoma but also suggest the need for a more careful evaluation of groups of donors, such as those dying from cerebral hemorrhage. Finally, recipients of organs from donors with cancer should be carefully followed to detect potential transmission.',\n",

The grief process was dynamic, continuous, and begun before the death of the child. Fathers and mothers reacted differently to the loss and experience of grief. The loss of a child definitively changed the parents' life and caused identity crisis and loss of life's purpose.

The most important mechanisms for this association are a \"port of entry\" and immune suppression. Sixteen studies dealt with the effect of short and mid-term cancer on the outcome of surgery of IE in these patients. No uniform management strategy could be identified.

However, the prognostic role of TLS in various tumors remains controversial. This meta-analysis aims to investigate the clinicopathological and prognostic values of TLS in solid tumors. <b>Methods:</b> A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library undated to November 2, 2020. Odds ratios of clinical parameters, hazard ratio (HR) of overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), disease-free survival (DFS) and relapse rate were calculated in order to evaluate the relationship between TLS expression and clinicopathological or prognostic values in different tumors. <b>Result:</b> 27 eligible studies including 6647 patients with different types of tumors were analyzed. High TLS expression was associated with a longer OS (HR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.50 - 0.86, <i>P</i> = 0.002) and RFS (HR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.47 - 0.79, <i>P</i> = 0.0001).

However, there was no relationship between TLS expression and DFS. Meanwhile, high TLS expression was associated with smaller tumor size (<i>P</i> < 0.00001) and higher tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Furthermore, the subgroup analysis showed high TLS expression that may be associated with a lower clinical grading and N stage in breast cancer and colorectal cancer. <b>Conclusion:</b> High TLS expression is associated with the longer OS and RFS in solid tumors, and a lower risk of cancer relapse. Meanwhile, high TLS expression is also associated with a smaller tumor size, higher infiltration of TILs, lower clinical grading and N stage in the tumor. Therefore, high TLS expression in the tumor is a favorable prognostic biomarker for solid tumor patients.',\n",
              " 'Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) results in long-term survival (≥10 years) in 85% of patients who survive transplant-related complications within the first 2 years posttransplant. Transplant survivors, however, are at an increased risk of chronic health conditions compared with the general population, including the emergence of secondary malignant neoplasms. In particular, female transplant survivors may face a greater risk of lower genital tract (cervical, vulvar, or vaginal) neoplasms due to chronic immune dysregulation in the peritransplant and posttransplant environment. Persistent immune suppression may facilitate the carcinogenesis of human papillomavirus (HPV), the causative agent of nearly all cervical cancers and most vulvar and vaginal cancers. Nevertheless, the risk of these cancers has not been sufficiently quantified in female transplant survivors. Small clinical studies have shown that the rate of cervical cytological abnormalities increases after allogeneic HCT, but large population-based studies have not consistently demonstrated an increased risk of secondary cervical cancer after transplant compared with the general population; the risk of developing secondary vulvar or vaginal cancer after transplant remains unclear. A better understanding of the natural history of HPV-associated lower genital tract neoplasms and their transplant-related risk factors would help delineate optimal long-term follow-up protocols in this population. In this systematic review, we summarize the current literature on this topic and discuss the implications for cervical cancer screening and vaccination in female transplant recipients.',\n",

A systematic search was performed of PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Only studies that included patients with synchronous liver metastases published in the era of multiagent chemotherapy (after 2011) were considered, excluding those with lung/peritoneal metastases or metachronous liver metastases. Median overall survival (OS) was the primary outcome. Six studies with 204 patients were analyzed. 63% of patients underwent upfront pancreatic and liver resection, 35% had surgery after primary chemotherapy with strict selection criteria and 2% had an inverse approach (liver surgery first). 38 patients (18.5%) did not undergo any liver resection since metastases disappeared after chemotherapy. Postoperative mortality was low (<\\u20092%). Median OS ranged from 7.6 to 14.5\\xa0months after upfront pancreatic/liver resection and from 34 to 56\\xa0months in those undergoing preoperative treatment. This systematic review suggests that surgical resection of pancreatic cancer with synchronous liver oligometastases is safe, and it can be associated with improved survival, providing a careful selection of patients after primary chemotherapy.',\n",

A search of PubMed (MEDLINE), Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane and Scopus databases was performed. A meta-analysis was conducted on five-year survival in gastric cancer patients using inverse variance random-effects methods. The literature search yielded 5329 potential titles, of which a total of seven studies were eligible. Results of six studies including a total of 1779 patients were pooled in the meta-analysis. Only 23 (1.3%) of the patients received neoadjuvant therapy. All six studies had a cut-off of 50% for the proportion of stroma when dividing the patients into low- and high stroma groups. Low TSR (high amount of stroma) was strongly associated with increased five-year mortality (hazard ratio 2.19, 95% CI 1.69-2.85). In conclusion, TSR is a strong prognostic factor in gastric cancer. It could be used to estimate prognosis of gastric cancer patients not receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Further studies including patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy are recommended.',\n",

The prevalence rate of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which represents about 85% of kidney cancers, has been increasing gradually in many developed countries. Family history has been considered as one of the most relevant risk factors for kidney cancer, although most forms of an inherited predisposition for RCC only account for less than four percent. Lifestyle and other factors such as occupational exposure, high blood pressure, poor diet, and heavy cigarette smoking are highly associated with its incidence and mortality rates. In the United States, White populations have the lowest prevalence of RCC compared to other ethnic groups, while Black Americans suffer disproportionally from the adverse effects of RCC. Hence, this review article aims at identifying the major risk factors associated with RCC and highlighting the new therapeutic approaches for its control/prevention. To achieve this specific aim, articles in peer-reviewed journals with a primary focus on risk factors related to kidney cancer and on strategies to reduce RCC were identified. The review was systematically conducted by searching the databases of MEDLINE, PUBMED Central, and Google Scholar libraries for original articles. From the search, we found that the incidence and mortality rates of RCC are strongly associated with four main risk factors, including family history (genetics), lifestyle (poor diet, cigarette smoking, excess alcohol drinking), environment (community where people live), and occupation (place where people work). In addition, unequal access to improvement in RCC cancer treatment, limited access to screening and diagnosis, and limited access to kidney transplant significantly contribute to the difference observed in survival rate between African Americans and Caucasians. There is also scientific evidence suggesting that some physicians contribute to racial disparities when performing kidney transplant among minority populations.

These data showed that the frequencies of mutations and copy number alterations in core clock genes (PER1/2/3, CLOCK, CRY1/2, and ARNTL) were low, but that the expression levels of core clock genes were downregulated by the higher levels of DNA methylation in most tumors. The circadian clock index (CCI) was established through a principal component analysis, and this measure well represents the overall expression of the core clock genes. In fact, the CCI was significantly lower in hepatocellular carcinoma with HBV infection than in other cancers.

Advances in surgery, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy have increased their efficacy and many patients survive for many years after their initial diagnosis. The eye is a rare site of metastasis from gynecological cancer due to its distant location from the genitalia. In this systematic review, we retrieved all case reports of patients with ocular metastasis from gynecological neoplasms. The demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics were retrieved and analyzed. A total of 70 case reports were included. Forty-eight of these reports concerned patients with a known malignancy that recurred in the eye and in 22 patients' ocular symptomatology accompanied the initial diagnosis of the gynecologic malignancy. 73.9% of these patients exhibited concomitant metastasis to other organs. The mean disease-free interval was found at 25.7 months and mean survival time after the eye metastasis was 13.5 months. Refractory disease was identified as the most important risk factor associated with mortality. Because eye metastasis has such a dismal prognosis, all gynecologists who treat oncological patients should be highly suspicious for reported eye complaints.\",\n",

However, there are currently no standardised molecular markers that assist in determining HNC prognosis. The literature for this systematic review and meta-analysis were sourced from multiple bibliographic databases. This review followed PRISMA guidelines. The Hazard Ratio (HR) was selected as the effect size metric to independently assess overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and prognosis. Subgroup analysis was performed for individual highly represented miRNA. A total of 6843 patients across 50 studies were included in the systematic review and 34 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Studies across 12 countries were assessed, with China representing 36.7% of all included studies. The analysis of the survival endpoints of OS and DFS were conducted separately, with the overall pooled effect size (HR) for each being 1.825 (95% CI 1.527-2.181; <i>p</i> < 0.05) and 2.596 (95% CI 1.917-3.515; <i>p</i> < 0.05), respectively.

Relevant studies for this review were defined as studies in which KDs were used complementary to surgery, radio-, chemo-, or targeted therapy and at least one of the following four outcomes were reported: (i) Overall survival (OS); (ii) progression-free survival (PFS); (iii) local control rate; (iv) body composition changes. Twelve papers reporting on 13 clinical studies were identified. Nine studies were prospective and six had a control group, but only two were randomized. KD prescription varied widely between studies and was described only rudimentarily in most papers. Adverse events attributed to the diet were rare and only minor (grade 1-2) except for one possibly diet-related grade 4 event.

The purpose of our study was to conduct a systematic literature search to determine the relationship between tobacco smoking pre-HCT and post-HCT outcomes. We conducted an electronic literature search from all languages from multiple peer-reviewed databases of studies that evaluated the effects of tobacco smoking prior to HCT on clinical outcomes. Data were extracted from the studies according to a strict selection criterion. Due to differences in primary endpoint and different populations evaluated in different studies, a meta-analysis was not possible, and a descriptive quantitative analysis is provided. Out of the 447 publications fulfilling the selection criteria for the electronic search, 17 articles were included in the final sample. The studies varied in terms of study design, patient characteristics, and HCT type. Considerable variability in definition of smoking was observed. We found that smoking pre-HCT was associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases, new infections, pulmonary complications, and cancers in comparison to non-smokers. Moreover, smoking pre-HCT was significantly associated with increased risks of both relapse and non-relapse mortality, and inversely related to median overall survival. Smoking adversely affects mortality in all HCT survivors by increasing the risks of both malignant and non-malignant complications. Thus, guidelines are urgently needed to formulate lifestyle factor modifications for HCT survivors focusing on smoking cessation strategies and abstinence maintenance in former smokers.

Literature collection was performed by searching the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases (up to October 7, 2017). A quantitative meta-analysis was conducted to assess the eligible articles on the prognostic value of HOX transcript antisense intergenic RNA in digestive cancers. The pooled hazard ratios or odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were used to evaluate the association between expression of HOX transcript antisense intergenic RNA and clinical outcomes. A total of 1844 patients from 22 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The results found a significant association between expression of HOX transcript antisense intergenic RNA and poor overall survival in digestive cancers (pooled hazard ratio = 2.19, 95% confidence interval, 1.86-2.57, P < .001). Furthermore, subgroup analysis showed that tumor type, region, Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and sample size did not alter the predictive value of HOX transcript antisense intergenic RNA as an independent factor for patients' survival.

The pooled hazard ratio (HR) of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), the relative risk (RR) of objective response rate (ORR) were calculated. Results Overall, a total of eight studies comprising 2979 patients were included. When generally comparing TP53 mutation group with TP53 wild-type group, we confirmed the prognostic value of poor OS of TP53 in EGFR mutant lung cancers (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.22-2.44, P = 0.002). In subgroup analysis of OS, the prognostic value was maintained in patients treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) but not in those treated with non-targeted therapy (HR 2.29, 95% CI 1.39-3.76, P = 0.001), and was also maintained in patients with advanced-stage lung cancers rather than those of all stages (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.11-3.61, P = 0.021). For patients treated with EGFR TKIs, TP53 commutation was predictive of a poor PFS (HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.42-3.36, P < 0.001) but the prognostic value on ORR was not observed (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.92-1.44, P = 0.212).

Dried fruits are generally perceived, by both consumers and researchers, as a less attractive but shelf-stable equivalent to fresh fruits and constitute a small but significant proportion of modern diets. Chemical compositions of raw and dried fruits, however, may differ substantially. Several clinical and laboratory intervention studies have reported the protective effects of dehydrated fruits against the progression of some cancers and the modulating effects of dried fruits on common cancer risk factors. In this systematic review, we identified, summarized, and critically evaluated 9 prospective cohort and 7 case-control studies that examined the relations between traditional dried fruit (raisins, prunes, dates) consumption and cancer risk in humans. Prospective cohort studies determined that significant reductions in relative risk of precancerous colorectal polyps, incidence of prostate cancer, or mortality from pancreatic cancer, by, respectively, 24%, 49%, and 65%, were associated with 3-5 or more servings of dried fruits per week. Selected case-control studies revealed inverse associations between dried fruit intake and risk of cancer as well. The reported associations were comparable to or stronger than those observed for total or raw fruits. Although the small number and high heterogeneity impede meta-analysis of these studies, we conclude that currently available data provide some initial evidence that consumption of dried fruits may be associated with a lower cancer incidence or mortality in populations. The data suggest that higher intake of raisins and other dried fruits may be important in the prevention of cancers of the digestive system.

Recent improvements in survival following a diagnosis of cancer have led to an increase in second primary cancers (SPCs) worldwide. Their aetiology remains largely unknown with a large proportion believed to be related to modifiable lifestyle factors. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published data that evaluated an association between cigarette smoking and risk of SPC. Studies were identified by searching Medline, Web of Science, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) and Scopus databases through March 2021 using broad search criteria. A meta-analysis was performed to derive pooled relative risks (RRs) for SPC defined a priori as smoking-related based on current evidence (lung, upper aero-digestive tract, stomach, pancreas, colorectum, liver, kidney, ureter, bladder and acute myeloid leukaemia). Eleven cohort studies and ten case-control studies met the eligibility criteria for review. There was marked heterogeneity in methods used in terms of classification and timing of smoking, confounders adjusted for and duration of follow-up across the studies. Nine cohort and seven case-control studies classified smoking habits prior to diagnosis of first cancer while the remaining studies classified post-first cancer smoking habits. In a meta-analysis using six studies, an increased risk of smoking-related SPC was observed for both former (RR=1.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-1.67) and current smoking (RR=2.76; 95% CI 2.29-3.33), compared with never smoking. The pooled RRs changed only slightly when studies which measured post-first cancer smoking were excluded. A two-fold increase in risk was observed for ever smoking compared with never smoking. In conclusion, there was evidence that smoking might increase the risk of SPC in cancer survivors.

We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for original articles published, without language restriction until September 2021. We assessed the risk of bias in each study and the overall quality of evidence for exposure-outcome pairs that were reported in two or more studies. Out of the 18 included studies, cross-sectional studies were the most common study design (n = 8), and most of the studies were conducted in Europe (n = 8). In terms of risk of bias, the majority of cohorts (four out of six) and case-control studies (three out of four) were of good or very good quality, and cross-sectional studies were mostly (five out of eight) of poor quality. Outcomes (incidence, prevalence, mortality) on different cancer sites were reported: lung cancer (n = 9), prostate cancer (n = 4), breast cancer (n = 4), skin cancer (n = 3), colorectal cancer (n = 2), all-sites cancer (n = 2), brain cancer (n = 1), mouth and throat cancer (n = 1), and esophageal cancer (n = 1). The meta-analyses for the breast, lung, and prostate cancer incidence did not show statistically significant associations (for example for breast cancer: hazard ratio = 0.83; 95% confidence interval: 0.47-1.48). For skin cancer, the available evidence suggests that greenspace could be a potential risk factor. For the other cancers, the evidence was non-conclusive. The overall quality of evidence of all of the exposure-outcome pairs was very low. Given the wide confidence interval of the pooled estimates and very low quality of evidence, the findings should be interpreted with caution. Future large and longitudinal studies are needed to assess the potential association of greenspace exposure with cancers, considering types and quality of greenspace, evaluation of cancer sub-types, and adjustment for a sufficient set of covariates.',\n",

The random effects model was used to combine the RRs. <b>Results:</b> Seventeen studies were eligible to be included in the systematic review, from which nine reports assessed the association between the DASH diet and risk of mortality from all cancer types, four assessed incidence of colorectal cancer, and two studies assessed the risk of colon and rectal cancer separately. Four studies examined the association with the incidence of other cancers (breast, hepatic, endometrial, and lung cancer). Meta-analysis showed that high adherence to DASH is associated with a decreased mortality from all cancer types (RR = 0.84, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 0.81-0.86). Participants with the highest adherence to the DASH diet had a lower risk of developing colorectal (RR = 0.79, 95%CI: 0.75-0.83), colon (RR = 0.80, 95%CI: 0.74-0.87), and rectal (RR = 0.84, 95%CI: 0.74-0.96) cancers compared to those with the lowest adherence. <b>Conclusion:</b> DASH-style diet should be suggested as a healthy approach associated with decreased risk of cancer in the community.

The significance of the expression of Galectin-3 has been correlated with various malignancy types and in data from several research papers, the expression of Galectin-3 has been associated with the progression and metastasis of breast cancer. In the present study, the authors' goal is to identify whether the expression of Galectin-3 in breast cancer can be associated with the presence and/or recurrence of a metastatic disease. Both Scopus and PubMed databases were utilized, by inputting the following combination of keywords: (((Breast) AND Metastasis)) AND ((Galectin 3) OR Galectin-3). The time of publication and text availability were not considered when searching the databases and all relevant articles in English were initially accepted. We included one case-control study, three retrospective case studies and one retrospective cohort study. In two of the included studies, the levels in concentration of Galectin-3 were not correlated with a significant difference in prognosis. In two studies, the lacking in expression of Galectin-3 was associated with a worse prognosis and in one of the studies selected, the elevated levels of Galectin-3 were correlated with recurrence of disease in triple negative breast cancer cases. For most of the studies selected for this review, the results were contradictory in regard to the role of Galectin-3 for prognosis and metastatic potential in female breast cancer patients. It is still unclear, whether Galectin-3 can be used as a prognostic marker for advanced breast cancer disease.\",\n",

However, most of this literature is limited by the small sample sizes and discrete outcomes. Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed to investigate the relation between XIST expression and tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and overall survival of cancer patients. We searched for literature in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the association of XIST expression with prognosis and clinicopathological characteristics of cancer patients. Finally, a total of 14 articles involving 1123 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The results suggested that high expression of XIST has a significant relationship with a relatively poor overall survival for patients with malignant tumors (HR 1.82; 95% CI 1.32, 2.52; <i>P</i> = 0.0003). Moreover, high expression of XIST was significantly associated with poor TNM stage (OR 3.64; 95% CI 2.62, 5.07; <i>P</i> < 0.0001), lymph node metastasis (OR 2.39; 95% CI 1.65, 3.46; <i>P</i> < 0.0001) and distant metastasis (OR 2.84; 95% CI 1.90, 4.23; <i>P</i> < 0.0001).

The study aimed to screen gene signatures associated with the development and metastasis of breast cancer and explore their regulation mechanisms. Three datasets of GSE10797, GSE8977 and GSE3744 were downloaded from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database, containing 55 breast cancer samples and 27 normal samples. After data preprocessing using limma software and RMA (robust multi-array average) algorithm, DEGs (differentially expressed genes) between breast tumor and normal tissues in three individual experiments were identified using MADAM package. Function and pathway enrichment analyses were performed for the DEGs. Transcription factors and TAGs (tumor associated genes) among the DEGs were recognized and the PPI (protein-protein-interaction) network for the DEGs was constructed using Cytoscape software. The mRNA expression was analyzed via real-time quantitative PCR and protein expression was measured by western blotting. Totally, 100 DEGs were identified, including 33 up-regulated genes and 67 down-regulated genes. Among them, up-regulated DEGs such as CD80 was enriched in toll-like receptor (TLR) interaction pathway and the TAG, ISG15 was related to RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, while CXCL10 was involved in both of the two pathways. Whereas, the down-regulated DEG, CXCL12 was significantly associated with axon guidance pathway. Additionally, these DEGs were also pivotal nodes in the PPI network with high degrees. Besides, CXCL10 and CD80 were both interacted with IFNG. The mRNA expression of ISG15 was obviously enhanced in human breast cancer cells MCF-7, while no significant difference of CXCL10 mRNA level was found between MCF10A and MCF-7 cells. Moreover, the proteins expression levels of CD80 and ISG15 were significantly increased in MCF-7, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells than in normal MCF10A cells. CD80 might be responsible for the breast cancer's progression and metastasis via regulating innate immune system. In addition, ISG15 is identified as a crucial gene signature associated with breast cancer development and metastasis via RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway.\",\n",

We searched PubMed, EMBASE and The Cochrane library (January 2018) for cohort studies examining the association between hormonal secretion on overall or recurrence-free survival in ACC. Methods A random-effects model meta-analysis was performed to obtain a weighted relative risk comparing cortisol-secreting and/or androgen-secreting ACCs to non-secreting tumours regarding overall and recurrence-free survival. Risk of bias assessment was performed for all studies included. Results Nineteen publications were included representing a total of 3814 patients. Most studies were generally considered low/intermediate risk of bias. Meta-analysis showed higher mortality risk for cortisol-secreting ACCs, weighted relative risk 1.71 (95% CI: 1.18-2.47) combining studies that adjusted for tumour stage; also a higher recurrence risk was found for cortisol producing ACCs, relative risk 1.43 (95% CI: 1.18-1.73).

The data was combined with a random-effect model by incorporating the between-study heterogeneity. Specifically, subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed to explore the association between TSR and survival in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or adenocarcinoma (AC). <b>Results:</b> Nine cohort studies with 2031 patients with NSCLC were eligible for the meta-analysis. Pooled results showed that compared to those stroma-poor tumor, patients with stroma rich NSCLC were associated with worse recurrence-free survival (RFS, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07 to 2.16, <i>p</i> = 0.02) and overall survival (OS, HR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.20 to 1.82, <i>p</i> < 0.001).

Typically, this strategy involves the addition of cancer-targeting biomolecules to nanoparticles, and studies on this topic have mainly focused on the localization of such formulations in tumors. Here, the analysis of the factors determining efficient nanoparticle targeting and therapy, various parameters such as types of targeting molecules, nanoparticle type, size, zeta potential, dose, and the circulation time are given. In addition, the important aspects such as how active targeting of nanoparticles alters biodistribution and how non-specific organ uptake influences tumor accumulation of the targeted nanoformulations are discussed. The analysis reveals that an increase in tumor accumulation of targeted nanoparticles is accompanied by a decrease in their uptake by the spleen. There is no association between targeting-induced changes of nanoparticle concentrations in tumors and other organs. The correlation between uptake in tumors and depletion in the spleen is significant for mice with intact immune systems in contrast to nude mice. Noticeably, modulation of splenic and tumor accumulation depends on the targeting molecules and nanoparticle type. The median survival increases with the targeting-induced nanoparticle accumulation in tumors; moreover, combinatorial targeting of nanoparticle drugs demonstrates higher treatment efficiencies. Results of the comprehensive analysis show optimal strategies to enhance the efficiency of actively targeted nanoparticle-based medicines.',\n",

Recently, tsncRNAs were postulated to be potentially useful biomarkers for tumor diagnosis and prognosis. However, there were no systematic reviews of prognostic and diagnostic tsncRNAs in neoplasms. The study aimed to decipher the relationships between tsncRNAs expression, diagnostic and prognostic outcome in tumors. <b>Methods:</b> This study systematically searched Google Scholar, MEDLINE, Scopus, PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, Ovid-Medline, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang and SinoMed databases for relevant articles published before September 21, 2020. <b>Results:</b> The study is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020213863). Fourteen relevant studies were included in the meta-analysis: 12 on diagnosis and 5 on prognosis. The pooled add ratio, 95% confidence intervals (Cl) and hazard ratios (HR) of the studies were used to investigate the clinical parameters and overall survival (OS) of cancer patients. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity was 0.79, 72%, and 73% in tumors, respectively. Though abnormally expressed tsncRNAs were associated with poor and unfavorable impacts on the OS time of cancer patients, the oncogenic tsncRNA may be a favorable impact on overall survival (OS: HR\\u2009=\\u20090.67, 95% Cl: 0.48-0.94, <i>P</i>\\u2009=\\u20090.02), and tumor-suppressor tsncRNA might have an unfavorable impact on overall survival (OS: HR\\u2009=\\u20091.41, 95% Cl: 0.84-2.37, <i>P</i>\\u2009=\\u20090.19). <b>Conclusion:</b> These results strongly suggested that tsncRNAs were potential novel prognostic and diagnostic indicators in tumors.',\n",

In this systematic review, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used. In vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies, which investigated the effect of PBMT on cell proliferation/differentiation, tumor growth, recurrence rate, and/or overall survival were included. The Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases were searched through April 2020. A total of 67 studies met the inclusion criteria with 43 in vitro, 15 in vivo, and 9 clinical studies identified. In vitro studies investigating the effect of PBMT on a diverse range of cancer cell lines demonstrated conflicting results. This could be due to the differences in used parameters and the frequency of PBM applications. In vivo studies and clinical trials with a follow-up period demonstrated that PBMT is safe with regards to tumor growth and patient advantage in the prevention and treatment of specific cancer therapy-related complications. Current human studies, supported by most animal studies, show safety with PBMT using currently recommended clinical parameters, including in Head & Neck cancer (HNC) in the area of PBMT exposure. A significant and growing literature indicates that PBMT is safe and effective, and may even offer a benefit in patient overall survival. Nevertheless, continuing research is indicated to improve understanding and provide further elucidation of remaining questions regarding PBM use in oncology.',\n",

A total of 15 cohort studies, including 1672 participants, were identified. Meta-analysis provided weak evidence in favour of segmental mandibulectomy for local control. Segmental mandibulectomy gave 73% better disease-free survival than marginal mandibulectomy when the marrow was invaded (P=0.04).

Correlations of E2F8 and clinico-pathological features were performed in TCGA. Enrichment of interacted and similar genes with E2F8 was evaluated in Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Metascape. We found that E2F8 was significantly up-regulated in tumor tissues compared with nontumor tissues (all P < 0.01). Moreover, E2F8 was significantly overexpressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) in HCC patients than that in healthy individuals (P < 0.001). Meta-analysis in Oncomine database confirmed that E2F8 was significantly higher in HCC tumors (P = 4.28E-08). Additionally, E2F8 elevation significantly correlated with overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), disease-specific survival (DSS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in HCC patients (all P < 0.01).

This study aims at determining which PFS measure, PFS assessed per immune-related response evaluation criteria (iPFS), or conventional criteria (cPFS), is the better surrogate endpoint for OS in trials of ICIs in lung cancer. We selected clinical trials in lung cancer that administered ICIs to at least one arm and reported both median OS and median PFS from PubMed, Embase, and The Cochrane Library. We compared the correlation between treatment effect (hazard ratio) on OS and cPFS or iPFS and the correlation between median OS and median cPFS or iPFS using weighted linear regression at trial level. We analyzed 78 ICI arms (13,438 patients) from 54 studies, including 66 arms with cPFS, seven arms with iPFS, and five arms with both kinds of PFS. We demonstrated an excellent correlation between treatment effect (hazard ratio) on OS and iPFS (R<sub>WLS</sub><sup>2</sup> \\xa0=\\xa00.91), while the correlation was moderate for cPFS (R<sub>WLS</sub><sup>2</sup> \\xa0=\\xa00.38).

Assessing the prevalence of sarcopenia among digestive cancers and establishing the impact that sarcopenia has on the postoperative evolution of digestive tumors may be a central pillar in improving postoperative outcomes by caring for perioperative sarcopenia. This brief review aimed to evaluate the prevalence of sarcopenia in digestive cancer patients. <b>Method and materials:</b> PubMed database was searched for \"sarcopenia\" AND \"digestive cancers\" from January 1st, 2010, through September 30th, 2020. PRISMA guideline was used for this systematic review. After the selection process, 31 complete studies were included in our review. Assessment of sarcopenia diagnosis for the studies included in this systematic review was based on a computed tomographic calculation of the skeletal muscle index at the third lumbar vertebra. <b>Results:</b> Among a total of 11,651 patients with digestive cancers, the prevalence of sarcopenia was 43.68%. The highest prevalence of sarcopenic patients was in esophageal (70.4%) and hepatic (60.3%) cancer, following by biliary tract (49.3%), pancreatic (45.70%), colorectal (42.83%) cancer, and gastric cancer (32.05%) with the lowest prevalence. The results of the studies conducted by now regarding the prevalence of sarcopenia in digestive cancers and its relevance in the evolution of these cancers are discordant and uneven. Some studies show that the presence of sarcopenia in patients with digestive cancers is associated with an increased rate of postoperative complications, increased toxicity of chemotherapeutics and increased mortality. Other studies do not find sarcopenia as an independent risk factor associated with negative consequences in the course of patients with digestive cancers. <b>Conclusions:</b> Sarcopenia is prevalent in digestive cancers. There is still no consensus about the impact of sarcopenia on the treatment of digestive cancers. Further studies are needed to evaluate the real consequences of sarcopenia in digestive cancers..',\n",

We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library (last update by December 28, 2017) for studies evaluating the effect of serum HDL-C levels on cancer patient prognosis. Data from 25 studies covering13,140 patients were included. Combined hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed using fixed-effects and random-effects models. High serum HDL-C levels were associated with better OS (pooled HR = 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.60-0.82). In the subgroup, the relative high level of HDL-C yielded a favorable outcome in most of tumor types. However, in the nasopharyngeal carcinoma subgroup, the correlation was not significant (combined HR = 1.31; 95% CI (0.91-1.90)). High serum HDL-C levels were associated with better DFS (pooled HR = 0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.50-0.81)).

A systematic review and meta- analysis to evaluate the risk of metachronous colorectal cancer (MCC) and mortality in LS following segmental and extensive colectomy. A systematic review of the PubMed database was conducted. Studies were included/ excluded based on pre-specified criteria. To assess the risk of MCC and mortality attributed to segmental or extensive colectomies, relative risks (RR) were calculated and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Publication bias was investigated using funnel plots. Data about mortality, as well as patient ascertainment [Amsterdam criteria (AC), germline mutation (GM)] were also extracted. Statistical analysis was conducted using the R program (version 3.2.3). The literature search identified 85 studies. After further analysis ten studies were eligible for inclusion in data synthesis. Pooled data identified 1389 patients followed up for a mean of 100.7\\xa0months with a mean age of onset of 45.5\\xa0years of age. A total 1119 patients underwent segmental colectomies with an absolute risk of MCC in this group of 22.4% at the end of follow-up. The 270 patients who had extensive colectomies had a MCC absolute risk of 4.7% (0% in those with a panproctocolecomy). Segmental colectomy was significantly associated with an increased relative risk of MCC (RR\\u2009=\\u20095.12; 95% CI 2.88-9.11; Fig.\\xa01), although no significant association with mortality was identified (RR\\u2009=\\u20091.65; 95% CI 0.90-3.02). There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of MCC between AC and GM cohorts (p\\u2009=\\u20090.5, Chi-squared test). In LS, segmental colectomy results in a significant increased risk of developing MCC. Despite the choice of segmental or extensive colectomies having no statistically significant impact on mortality, the choice of initial surgical management can impact a patient's requirement for further surgery. An extensive colectomy can result in decreased need for further surgery; reduced hospital stays and associated costs. The significant difference in the risk of MCC, following segmental or extensive colectomies should be discussed with patients when deciding appropriate management. An individualised approach should be utilised, taking into account the patient's age, co-morbidities and genotype. In order to determine likely germline-specific effects, or a difference in survival, larger and more comprehensive studies are required.\",\n",

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of single agent ICIs in these pre-defined subgroups. The electronic databases PubMed and EMBASE were searched for relevant randomized trials. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were meta-analyzed using the generic inverse variance method. Nine studies were included. Compared with chemotherapy, the use of single agent ICIs in the second-line setting reduced the risk of death independent of PD-L1 expression (HR, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-0.96 and HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.85 for patients with PD-L1-negative and -positive tumors, respectively).

Recently, the CARMENA trial showed that sunitinib alone was not inferior to CN plus sunitinib, and could be followed by subsequent CN in good-responders patients. CN is found to be a morbid surgery (perioperative mortality rate of 0-13% and major postoperative complications rate of 3-36%) and should be avoided in patients with primary refractory disease, using targeted therapy as a selection tool.

We systemically searched for active-controlled, second-line NSCLC trials. The milestone time point was set at one-year based on pre-analysis. A two-stage meta-analytic validation model was adopted to assess associations between surrogate endpoint (SE) and OS and associations between treatment effects on SE and OS. Treatment effects on SE and OS were expressed as PFS hazard ratios (HR<sub>PFS</sub> ), 1 yr-milestone ratio (Ratio<sub>1y-SUR</sub> ) and HR<sub>OS</sub> . Subgroup analyses stratified by treatment types and trial publication years evaluated the surrogacy in different clinical contexts. The study included 50 trials with 22,804 patients. One-year survival strongly correlated with OS (R<sup>2</sup> [95% confidence interval]: one-year survival -median OS = 0.707 [0.704-0.708]; Ratio<sub>1y-SUR</sub> -HR<sub>OS</sub> = 0.829 [0.828-0.831]). No correlation was established between PFS and OS (median PFS-median OS = 0.100 [0.098-0.101]; HR<sub>PFS</sub> -HR<sub>OS</sub> = 0.064 [0.059-0.069]), except in immunotherapy subgroup (HR<sub>PFS</sub> -HR<sub>OS</sub> = 0.835 [0.791-0.918]). In subgroup analyses, surrogacy of one-year survival persisted in different clinical contexts, and the disassociation between PFS and OS persisted in recent trials. One-year milestone survival showed strong surrogacy for OS in second-line NSCLC trials. Although no association was identified between PFS and OS, the strong HR<sub>PFS</sub> -HR<sub>OS</sub> correlation in immunotherapy trials indicates the potential of PFS as a SE in NSCLC trials involving immunotherapies.',\n",

Although surgical resection is still the gold standard, minimally invasive endobronchial procedures have emerged as a parenchyma sparing alternative for tumors located in the central airways. This review was performed to identify the optimal treatment strategy for pulmonary carcinoid, with a particular focus on the feasibility and outcome of parenchyma sparing techniques versus surgical resection. A systematic review of the literature was carried out using MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane databases, based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement. Two separate searches of publications in endobronchial and surgical treatment in patients with pulmonary carcinoid, were performed. Outcomes were overall survival, disease free survival, recurrence rate, complications, quality of life, and healthcare costs. Combining the two main searches for endobronchial therapy and surgical therapy yielded 3111 records. Finally, 43 studies concerning surgical treatment and 9 studies related to endobronchial treatment for pulmonary carcinoid were included. Assessment of included studies showed that lymph node involvement, histological grade, tumor location and tumor diameter were identified as poor prognostic factors and seem to be important for patients with pulmonary carcinoid. For patients with a more favorable prognosis, tumor location and tumor diameter are important factors that can help decide on the optimal treatment strategy. Centrally located small intraluminal pulmonary carcinoids, without signs of metastasis can be treated with minimally invasive alternatives such as endobronchial treatment or parenchyma sparing surgical resection. Patients with parenchyma sparing resections should be followed with long term follow up to exclude recurrence of disease. In a multidisciplinary setting, it should be determined whether individual patients are eligible for parenchyma sparing procedures or anatomical resection.

Although medication non-adherence to endocrine breast cancer therapies is common, so far only limited systematic evidence has been available on its quantitative consequences, as previous systematic reviews focused mainly on factors contributing to medication non-adherence. The objective of this review was to explore the implications of medication non-adherence to endocrine therapies on hard clinical outcomes in breast cancer based on real-world studies. A systematic literature review was conducted on PubMed; empirical evidence on hard clinical endpoints (i.e., survival, disease-free survival, metastasis and recurrence) were extracted from uni- or multivariate statistical analyses from retrospective or prospective cohort studies. Of the 2,360 identified records, 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. Two studies identified significant positive association between medication non-adherence and the risk of distant metastasis, three articles between medication non-adherence and the recurrence of breast cancer, two studies between medication non-adherence- and non-persistence and of worse disease-free survival and eight articles between medication non-adherence and mortality. There was only one study where the positive association between medication adherence and survival did not apply to all subgroups. The strong evidence on the negative health consequences of non-adherence to breast cancer treatments indicates the need for the regular monitoring of medication adherence. Furthermore, explicit inclusion of adherence enhancing interventions into health policy agenda would be warranted to improve medication adherence also at a system level.',\n",

Adherence by at least one measure to E-DATs was >70% in 8 of 8 RCTs. Compared with controls, E-DATs significantly improved patients' step count in 3 of 5 RCTs, activity level in 6 of 9 RCTs, and HRQoL in 7 of 9 RCTs (all <i>P≤</i>05), with no significant changes in biomarkers (eg, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor α, C-reactive protein, c-peptide, lipid panel) in 3 RCTs. Duration of E-DAT was not significantly correlated with adherence or study retention. <b>Conclusions:</b> This systematic review shows that E-DATs are feasible to implement in cancer survivors. Future research should examine the optimal type, dose, and schedule of E-DATs for cancer survivors.\",\n",

              " 'Extramural venous invasion (EMVI) is a well-known prognostic factor in colorectal cancer (CRC). Vascular invasion within the bowel wall, intramural vascular invasion (IMVI), has received less attention and its incidence and prognostic importance in CRC is not completely known. A systematic literature search was performed focusing on the impact of IMVI in CRC. Data were analysed using Review Manager version 5.3 on incidence and clinical endpoints local recurrence, 5-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) and 5-year overall survival (OS). Meta-analysis was performed in terms of risk ratios (RR) and hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Of the initial 1199 papers identified by our search strategy, 20 were included in this meta-analysis. Of the 8078 included patients, 1008 patients had IMVI (12.5%). Studies that re-examined histological slides showed a higher incidence of IMVI compared to studies extracting IMVI from pathology reports (17.6 versus 7.7%, P < 0.001). Detection of IMVI increased significantly with the use of additional staining (22.9 versus 12.3%, P < 0.001). IMVI was associated with a decreased CSS HR: 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.2 in multivariate analysis). A borderline significant effect was observed for IMVI on local recurrence (RR: 1.5, 95% CI: 0.98-2.3) and OS (RR: 1.2, 95% CI: 1.0-1.4). In conclusion, despite the limited number of studies, there is a clear association with outcome in the presence of IMVI. This warrants more attention to this under-reported prognostic factor.',\n",

              " 'Introduction: Cervical cancer rates vary across the world, being highest in Eastern Africa (including Zimbabwe) and lowest in Western Asia. It is the second most common type of cancer in women in the South East Asia region and a major cause of cancer deaths among women of low and middle income countries (LMICs) like Nepal. This review is an attempt to make a comprehensive report of prevalence, incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in LMICs. Methods: The review was conducted applying a computerized search with the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) major topics “Cervical Cancer”, “Cervical neoplasm” “Epidemiology”, (“prevalence” OR “incidence” OR “mortality”) and “HPV” OR “Human papillomavirus” as MeSH subheading. The search limits were: language (“English”), LMICs, dates (articles published from “1st January 2000 to 31st December 2015”), and species (“Humans”). The search was supplemented by cross-referencing. Publications that met the inclusion criteria were included in the synthesis. Results: Among the 20 studies reviewed; seven were from Africa, seven from Asia, three from South America, and one each from North America, Europe and Oceania. The review found the highest reported age standardized incidence rate as 17.9/100,000/year in Zimbabwe in 2000 and the lowest as 0.11/100,000/year in China in 2006. One study of Nigeria revealed a cervical cancer prevalence of 5.0 per 1,000 in 2012 in the 25-64 year age group. Further, the highest reported age standardized mortality rate was 16/100,000/year in India in 2015 and the lowest 1.8/100,000/year in Colombia in 2013. In addition, coitarche, tobacco smoking, number of sexual partners and family history of cervical cancer were reported as significant risk factors. Conclusion: The study provides a review of reported prevalence, incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in LMICs from 1st January 2000 to 31st December 2015. The scarcity of information reveals a substantial need for further studies on cervical cancer prevalence, incidence and mortality with associated risk factors in LMICs.',\n",
